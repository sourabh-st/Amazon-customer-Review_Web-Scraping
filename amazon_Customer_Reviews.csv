0,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 December 2018,Sameer Patil,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Which iPhone you should Purchase ? iPhone 8, X, XS, XR ?","  NOTE:@ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month.@ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone.This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money.BUILT QUALITY :--------------------# iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible  to easy damages.# iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR.# Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed.# To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice.DISPLAY :-----------# iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio.# Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P# According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :-----------------------------# I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8.# If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily.# I found X to be better value for money in this segment.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :------------------------------# All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging.# XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time.*XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours.# With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours.# Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance.CAMERA :-----------# In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera.* Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent.# XS sometimes does better over X, but not always.# Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly.# Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion.PRICE (64GB) :---------------8 - Rs.55KX - Rs.75KXR - Rs.77kXS - Rs.99K# Here certainly 8 is winner :PP.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy.VERDICT :-----------After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice.If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS.To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter.If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade.Hope this review helps."
1,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,17 November 2018,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy iPhone xr from Amazon.,  Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.
2,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 January 2019,A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with the purchase,  Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon
3,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,2 May 2019,Shubham Dutta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon is not an apple authorised reseller. Please take a note.,"  So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!"
4,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,24 May 2019,Nepuni Lokho,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Battery life and buttery smooth UI,"  I've been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It's been more than one month since I got this phone and I'm loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I'm using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever.The camera is better compared to my previous android phone. The camera support ""live photo"" which I disabled it because I'm not used to it. It supports video recording at 4K 60 FPS. The camera also supports panorama mode which gives amazing results. Selfie is also good and the screen light up as flashlight when taking a selfie in the dark.I'm not a gamer but I play Clash Royale and the game works smoothly. Since the phone has the latest processor I'm sure it won't be a problem even with the latest game.I'm loving iOS so far but I miss the bottom keys found on Android. iOS is fluid and there are no flaws in the OS which I've encountered. I've got two minor iOS updates after my purchase and love how updates are distributed globally all at the same time. One minor inconvenience I found on iOS is to download apps more than 150 MB I'm forced to connect to wifi and so far I've not found a work around it. I got adapted to gesture navigation like it was something I've been using for ages.Face ID is an absolute joy to have as I don't have to do anything to unlock my phone, I just hold my phone and the phone is unlocked. And did I mention that Face ID works even in the dark? The lack of notification LED is not a big inconvenience as the screen lights up to show the notification every time I hold up my phone.Regarding the huge criticism it got for the low screen resolution, I don't see any problem as I hardly stream YouTube in 4K. I can view YouTube videos in 1080p without a problem which I feel is good enough as service providers in India never give enough data speed to stream videos in 4K. Regarding the screen in direct sunlight, there's no problem as the screen is clearly visible even under direct sunlight.The speakers on this one are a huge plus point over other devices as the speakers give a 3D surround sound like system. I love the speakers on this phone. Regarding the lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack, I see no problem as the phone is bundled with an earphone which connects to the phone.And yeah If you're wondering how Siri is, let me tell you that google assistant is a much better one. I've installed google assistant and I use google assistant more than Siri as google assistant is more practical. If I were to rate google assistant and Siri on a scale, 10 being the best then I would rate Siri at 5 and google assistant at 9.Overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I got it at 58,500 rupees for the 64 GB version. If anyone wants to give iOS a try then I highly recommend iPhone XR as it is the latest devices from Apple at a reasonable price. The one thing that pushed me into iOS is that Apple gives OS update for 6 years and there is no delay in OS updates. On Android, it is a pain waiting for the manufacturer to release the update after Google outs the update.  I hope my simple review of iPhone XR helped you. Thank you for reading. Cheers.Update 17th Nov 2019:I'm able to download any file size app without having to depend on Wi-Fi after the recent updates. And the iOS 13 bought lots of new updates. The default image editing app included from iOS 13 is a great one and we can revert to the original image even after saving the edited photo. I love how the camera consistently delivers great images. I kinda miss the wide-angle camera on the iPhone 11 but if you have an iPhone XR it's no big deal. So far I've had no problem with my iPhone XR. With the price drop, this phone is a steal. I'm not gonna buy another latest iPhone because the price drops astronomically when a new generation iPhone is released. For people looking to try a new generation iPhone, this is the perfect deal because even the iPhone 11 has the same screen as iPhone XR. The few differences I noticed between iPhone XR and iPhone 11 is the new wide-angle camera and the front-facing camera wide-angle mode. Peace."
5,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,22 April 2019,Anand S Prasad,1.0 out of 5 stars,Never purchase a phone online.,  I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online
6,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,7 December 2018,Srikanth Jatla,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome iPhone,"  It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase."
7,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,25 November 2018,KAILASH C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Exchange of I phone xr with xs.,"  The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.I would like to exchange the product with I phone xs, if possible.Kindly help. Regards & thank you."
8,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 April 2019,LDM,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth upgrading from the 6S? I'll know in a few months,"  I'll use this review to mostly say what I'm not a fan of in this particular iPhone model.But first, what's good.Battery life is excellent so far. Charged to 97% 16 hours ago and I'm at 77% currently - though I have not used the phone much in that period. Sound quality is a touch better than on the 6S, I think. Portrait mode on the camera is great. Everything else is more or less the same. The chip is faster, but my old phone wasn't slow in the least, so there's no palpable difference really. The screen resolution is the same, as far as I'm aware. I haven't had occasion to test the water resistance, but it's definitely good to have.What's not so good.The weight. This is supposed to be 194 grams, which is more than 30% greater than the weight of the iPhone 6S, my old phone. It certainly feels like it. Add about 25-odd grams for even the lightest case. (And you do need a case - this is a super-slippery phone.) On the plus side, you're pretty much always conscious of it being in your pocket, and you'll probably notice if it fell out.The size feels somewhat monstrous, at least for now. 6.1 inches is massive, coming from the 4.7 of the 6S. Combine the extra size with the extra weight and I feel less secure and comfortable holding this phone in one hand than I did my old phone. It generally feels less ""manoeuvrable"" than a smaller phone. And my hands are reasonably large. That translates to a somewhat poorer experience overall. Anyway, I can't complain - I knew about the size before making the purchase, but just a note for people who are thinking of upsizing. The good thing about that is that I'll probably use the phone less - which is something we all need to do, in general.Face ID has been a bit of a pain for me so far. Doesn't work when you have sunglasses on, or in low-light conditions, though it is supposed to ""learn"" your face and get better as you go along. Three weeks in, I can't say there has been much of a change. Would have loved to have an option to immediately evoke the passcode input, which now takes more than two seconds to come up after Face ID fails. The only thing I like about Face ID at the moment is that it lowers the volume of alerts if you're looking at the phone.When I'm out walking with this phone in my hand, I usually take care to have the screen angled towards the ground, so that the sensor does not ""see"" my face somehow and bring the screen to life. But it does do this off and on. Worse, when the screen comes alive like this, if a song is playing, my thumb or fingers end up skipping or re-playing the track.I don't know if the Tru Tone on my unit is wonky but the warmth of the backlighting seems to change more often than it did on my old phone.The absence of a headphone jack is, as millions of people have observed, a severe pain in the neck for those who don't want to use wireless earphones that make you look like an alien and are based on Bluetooth, which feels past its time as a protocol.Spotify is quite buggy, but then it was nearly as bad on my old phone, so that's probably a Spotify problem.People talk about the massive bezel, but to me, unless someone is pointing it out to me, I don't really notice it. It'll be different for those who have used the X, I suppose.I can't say I'm regretting having bought this. I probably wouldn't have bought it just yet, if I hadn't planned on giving my 6S to a family member. I hope it grows on me.UPDATE, 25 June 2019:Three months in, I have got completely used to the size and weight of this phone in the hand. One-handed operation is still not safe or convenient but I have stopped thinking of it as a massive phone. When I hold an iPhone 5s in my hand, it now feels impossibly small.Face ID still does not recognise my face when I'm wearing dark glasses. It does usually recognise it with or without regular glasses on, however. But sometimes, in low-light conditions, I need to move the phone up to face level before it will unlock. Apple might need to consider allowing users to add more than the one alternative look in Face ID that it does at present before this problem is solved.The problems I had with the screen waking up have almost vanished. I suppose it was the edges of my fingers touching the screen inadvertently when I held it in my hand that woke it up."
9,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,21 April 2019,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Def a bad experience,  Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.The delivery and the product was perfect3 days in and I started to experience issuesA.The Phone microphone stopped working as a result I can not use any functionality of the phone no calls/no video recording/no voice recording or voice messages.B. The camera in jus the photo mode has also slowed down it takes over 15 secs to click and store a pic to galleryI have initiated a replacement option with Amazon within just 3 days of the purchase.in hindsight I now am starting to see why people shop in stores.
10,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,21 July 2019,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible Experience with Amazon,"  Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating.Horrible experience with Amazon."
11,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 January 2019,dasharthsingh  rajpurohit akherajot,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best of best quality,  Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon
12,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 April 2019,Tarun Pandey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone, if you don't care about OLED screen, colors","  Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far.Four things I have noticed which make difference in XS and XR .1) 3D touch-  I don't feel it makes a lot of difference.2) OLED Screen which is in XS and XR have LCD screen. - You may see a negligible difference between screen of both phone.3 ) Picture Quality - Due to OLED screen picture quality of the XS is better than XR. You may notice this if OLED screen and XR screen.4) Dual Camera - Blur background picture can be taken through Dual Camera, which is missing in XR.As a iphone lover, I have purchase XR and don't want to shed another 27K for above four features so havent purchased XS.This phone was not available in stores in Noida and Delhi but amazon deliver it in 2 days.Kudos to Amazon for timely delivery."
13,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,4 April 2019,iAakash,5.0 out of 5 stars,It fulfilled my expectations.,  Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. It’s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Don’t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes it’s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness.
14,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,4 June 2019,Sanjeev,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Dark Horse,"  There are lots of reviews on net for XR, I would give just quick points based on my experience of XR 128 GB.Pros:1). Perfect size for a phone for playing game, consuming social media and entertainment.2). Probably best battery ever in iPhone. I use to charge it once in 2 days despite all day calls, music and YouTube usage. Though I don’t play much game on it.3). Superb loudSpeaker and call reception. Very clear sound quality.4). Fantastic build quality with Glass back providing wireless charging5). Super camera at back and it does the job more than satisfactory. 12 MP processor has been utilised at utmost level. Don’t go by merely MP numbers, apple image processor is superb even at 12 MP. Front camera gives very nice portrait shots. It just does the job without much of beautification processing like in other android devices.6). Awesome face recognition even in pitch dark condition. It works in collaboration with multiple sensors and front camera unlike other contemporary phones which are purely dependent on front camera. Which results into 100% safe locking. And also it’s very fast under any situation. Just tap on the screen and the phone is ready to work instantly. You don’t even realise that there is a lock/unlock processing.7). Fantastic screen with smoothest interface. iOS works magically on XR. Though there are some negative reviews on net for the screen but I don’t feel an iota of issue in this marvellous screen. Yes you can’t count pixels in it. It’s just perfect screen. Watching YouTube is perfectly fine on this device.8). XR is a Monster in speed and processing. It surely miles ahead of its android counterparts.9). Heptic touch is 100% precise and very responsive10). With current discount of 17 K plus HDFC cashback this is undoubtedly a value for money product.11). Considering the trend this phone will take at least 4-5 iOS update which means it will be in mainstream product line even after 3-4 years which is not the case for any Android device.12. It’s perfect package and best option against XSMax. No overheating, No lag in app switching, It just bang on.Cons:1). No headphone connector for 3.5 mm jack though it comes with lightning headphone instead of 3.5 mm jack. It’s not cool as considering the price apple should have given the connector. Original connector cost 900 INR2). No fast charging adapter. It comes with 5wt charger which takes almost 3 hours for complete charging. Though it support fast charging. Apple should have given a fast charger in packing.3). Though I am ok with notch, many people might not like the cut. However Once you get use to it, this becomes unnoticeable.4). Slightly thick bezels and heavy weight which is again not a deal breaker. As you hold this device you feel the sturdy and quality product Fromm Apple.5). Finger print scanner is gone and people might miss it in this mobile. However after a week usage I am now much more comfortable with this departure.Verdict:With current Apple discount, XR 128 GB is a perfect buy. If you have the budget, don’t think twice just go for it. Considering the price gap between XR and XSMax I would say XR is a better buy in every aspect with same Camera, Hardware and build quality. It has an advantage of future iOS update over its android competitors.Above all this, XR is IP67 certified which means now you need not to worry about splashes and dust. It’s safer, stronger and better iPhone in every sense.Last but not the LeastBuy only from Amazon/Appario as they give 100% genuine product in perfectly intact condition."
15,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 January 2019,Ankita Saikia,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not supporting any sim,  It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only
16,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 November 2018,Prabhat,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hang’s many time,  Don’t buy this phone only waste of money it hang’s many time.
17,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,9 December 2018,Sonu Klaynia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Network Issue if you are using dual sim in iPhone XR,  Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off.
18,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,15 September 2019,Mondal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Problem with Dual SIM,"  iPhone XR is excellent there is no doubt about this. This first time my iPhone experience. Its great experience. But I am very unhappy about the dual sim performance (May be solved the problem).I have Airtel e-sim its working fine. But my JiO physical sim did not show any VOLTE option. I have called to Jio customer care, they said my iPhone doses not support VOLTE. But the same SIM works in VOLTE mode  in my android device (Rs. 12K phone) I did not get any help from Apple still now. I have search several option from online and you tube but could not fix it. If this problem is serious, so why I need such premium phone of worth Rs. 50K more.I would be happy if any I Phone XR user can help me regarding this."
19,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,6 June 2019,Munnagkumar Anne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Buy!! iPhone XR full fills the dream of big iPhone,"  i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but don’t have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase.Please ignore all the negative reviews. This is an awesome phone and we should never doubt apple product. They are simply the best and XR was no exception.Please note that this is not iPhone XS so it certainly won’t have what XS has! And the price difference between XR and XS is 40k (as on the moment of this review). Therefore, you get what you pay for!Pros:Battery (played 10 PUBG games back to back and the phone still had 40percent)Facial recognition works great even at nights under low lightBig iPhone at cheaper priceColour choice (red looks stunning)Lowest version starts with 64gbProcessor speed. (Playing HD games with ease)ConsCamera portrait mode is not as effective as other phonesIs it worth buying in June 2019?Yes! Most definitely. I tell you why! Apple marketing strategies are amazing. They already stopped producing iPhone X because it is an excellent phone and people were buying it.  If X continues to be in market for cheaper price it will redirect the XS sales.XR and XS continues to shine in market for another 1 year and you can use them happily without an upgrade for at least two more years.So if you’re upgrading from iPhone 6s or 7! This is still a best choice for this price range! I bought this offer for 53k so it’s totally worth of every penny! Go for it!!!"
20,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,13 July 2019,Ankur Arora ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake handsetset received,  Im facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty
21,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,10 September 2019,Ayush Kumar Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"got at ₹49,900 but do i wasted my 50k?? ABSOLUTELY NO!","  there are two angles from which smartphones are generally looked. and i will be very honest in this review so that a genuine user can understand if he really wants apple!the first angle is -  SHOW OFF PURPOSE! here price doesn’t matter to most of the people and they should not need to read any reviews or any other thing about smartphone, just go and buy any latest iPhone. no one is even near to apple when it comes to brand value. i have written that price doesn’t matter because if price really mattered to you than you would have never thought of wasting money on showing-off!the second angle is - SOFTWARE AND PRIVACY PURPOSES. here u are sure that u don’t need an android, u want apple and the only reason u are checking XR rather than XS or XS MAX is that u can’t afford them and u want value for money. let me tell you straightforward, any iPhone will never offer you value for money. especially to us (indian consumers) and the kind of market we are witnessing in last couple of years, the aggressive pricing from xiaomi, realme (my personal best) etc. will never let us fell that iPhone is value for money. the truth is there is no second angle, the people who says that they use iPhone for privacy are 90% liars. i agree that 10% who are very rich and really need to secure their mobile can mean it. and here i don’t mean that that they cant use android. but from point of view of common public, it’s absolutely rubbish to think iPhone is any better. their is not much difference between android and ios when it comes to security and privacy. people just purchase it for the first angle which i mentioned (show-off) but need a reason so that they can convince themselves and others that they didn’t wasted their money by purchasing such an expensive smartphone!now coming specifically to iPhone XR. let’s start with price! it’s apple and by no means i will try to justify it’s actual price which is about around 76k and even after price cut it is around 60k. but on prime day sale i got it worth 50k which was superb considering it’s actual price but the question is, in the era of xiaomi, one plus is it still worthy to spend 50k on the smartphone which is not even considered as premium. as u know that this is the cheapest iPhone of it’s generation. and to tell you further, i am sure after release of iphone 11 price will get reduced and come around 50k because that’s what prime day sale price hinted to us!so, still i have given it 5 stars and i don’t feel that i have wasted my money. why?? the sole reason is, as i told earlier - SHOW-OFF. there is allmost nothing that iPhone is offering me and android can’t and this, i am telling u after two months of switching from android to ios! this is very important thing you should know before switching to iPhone. don’t convince urself to purchase an iPhone just for security purposes and all that lie which is in market to make you believe that iPhone is extravagant. android and ios are equally better, atleast for common consumers! when it comes to iPhone, everything boils down to show-off. if you want to show-off purchase it. i am not saying that anything is wrong in it. i also purchased it for show-off. THANKS."
22,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,6 February 2019,Nitesh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointment for an iPhone,  This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.
23,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,5 February 2020,Meher k.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic Apple and IPhone Review,  I had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues. When we talk the mouth pice is not that precise to hold you voice creaky the voice is not audible if the phone is even partially away from your chin/mouth.
24,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,24 April 2019,Neel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go for XR if you confused between X and XR,  All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules
25,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,25 June 2019,Aniruddha Ghosh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing in many ways,  Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies aren’t good at all. You can’t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records that’s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.Faceid rear camera and battery life good. Front camera is of inferior quality. Very heavy and display is of inferior quality. Cracking noise when on speaker. Overall not a good investment of rs 59000
26,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 October 2019,Rituparno Das,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is spectacular,"  I have bought it during prime sales , aside from discount i have bought it by paying just 36kBiggest con is they are not providing you a fast charger with this premium segment .Biggest pro is the battery life which will provide you 9-10 hours screen on time with heavy use with all the time internet usage ."

29,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,15 April 2019,Manohar Mali,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Phone,"  Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp."
30,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,14 May 2019,Alfred,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awsome Product by Apple,  This is by far the best smartphone i have ever owned.I bought this phone after watching so many reviews in the youtube and all other places.I am seriously in love with this phone.And this is genuine apple product provided by Amazon.I was scared to buy this online but as usual amazon provides u the best product available.Thr camera is best not as best as Xs or X but it is much better tha many single camera flagships.Battery life is execellent as i didnt expect it to be this better i charge in the morning and i use it till next day and still 40 to 50% is there but that depends on your usage.The potrait mode only works with only humans and not objects or animals this might be minus as pixel offers u much better experience for potrait.By far its  really tye best phone to own.I was using android for all this years i wanted a change and didnt knew that i would love ios so much.Its easy to use its better in every way. ❤❤

My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered.

33,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,11 June 2019,Kusan Majumder,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best Choice !,"  Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with it’s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, it’s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that it’s an LCD screen but you’ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 o’clock, i still had 66% charge. That’s what we needed in an iPhone.In a nutshell, I would say go for it if you have lessened your budget a bit, because it’s one of the best apple iPhones I have used and would also like to thank Amazon for such a superbbb service 👍🏻"
34,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,9 December 2019,Prince kumar,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just don’t buy it from amazon totally waste of money.,   Iphone is good but probably I have received a defective piece from amazon as I am facing issues with software. Further never heard a iphone to be hanging issue but I am facing the same and attached a video regarding it. Within a month I have to visit customer care and still facing issues. Very worst experience don’t buy it from amazon.
35,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 August 2019,Dinesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed !!!,"  This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market."
36,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 May 2019,Suraag,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing phone! iOS makes it worth the money! Delivered 3 days late by the seller.,"  Best iPhone I’ve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this would’ve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that!When it comes to software, iOS is simple the best. You get a lot less features but almost everything works smooth and perfect unlike android. My old phone had a ton of features like gesture controls which rarely ever worked. There’s a lot of attention to detail in small bits like animations and haptic feedback in iOS. Daily used apps like whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit have better optimisation than android. Introduction of haptic feedback feels very natural in  these apps This makes it feel premium. Also iOS is miles ahead than android when it comes to touch response and software understanding. I can type twice as fast on this than android phones. The phone is clever enough to understand unintentional touches on the screen. These things used to annoy me a lot on android. This is one of the main reasons I switched back to iPhone. Typing on iOS is way better no matter which keyboard app you get from play store. Also, Gesture navigation is very smooth. Nothing comes close.I really like how apple has designed the software to handle the notch. Surprisingly the notch on this doesn’t bother me as much as the one plus 6 did, even though it is much larger in size. It’s mainly because they didn’t try to cram it with a dozen icons.Well balanced stereo speakers are a good addition to the phone. You get true stereo imaging without any ear fatigue in just one ear over long period of usage.Camera is one of the best you get in the market right now though pixel 3 takes better pictures in low light. Video shooting is the best on any phone. Camera is the same as iPhone XS without optical zoom and taking portrait of objects or pets. Portrait mode only works for human faces.Battery life is great. Easily lasts me more than a day. In fact it’s better than iPhone XS and XS Max. There’s no fast charging but I’m fine with it since I charge my phone over night.There is no 3D Touch on this one but they’ve added haptic touch which covers control centre toggles, moving the cursor on keyboard and lock screen actions. Only thing you’re missing out on is shortcuts on home screen and peek and pop.Dual sim seems to work fine. Been using Vodafone and Jio (e sim)Build quality seems alright. I would recommend getting a sturdy case since the phone is covered in glass.Overall it’s an amazing phone. It is a lot more expensive than phones like one plus, pixel 3a, galaxy s10e and has less specs to offer on paper but the software makes up for it. The price you’re paying is for the unmatched software integration.If you’re coming from an old iPhone, go for it! You won’t be disappointed!If you care more about an OLED screen, portrait mode for pets and objects and 3D Touch, go for iPhone XS or XS Max. Personally I don’t think they are worth 40-50k extra for just these 3 features."

Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in.
42,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,21 June 2020,Shivam,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the premium price,"  Hello there,Been using this phone for almost an year now. And I regret buying it!!I start with Pros1. Apple phones are excellent in build quality. Same goes for XR. Beautiful design.2. Software experience is fluid. Design and user experience is good. Thanks to good integration between hardware and software3. Apple boasts of top notch security features4. Face ID is unique & works every single time5. App Store has the largest collection of apps. There’s an app for everything.Now taking a pragmatic approach1. The phone is fragile. Camera bump placement makes life even more difficult. I have never dropped it; but I won’t be getting it repaired if I ever drop it!2. Camera is all-hype. It’s good, but not as life changing as the company claims. I have used Pixel 3 which is industry standard and it beats iPhone cameras by a mile3. Apple App Store is all about milking customers of the money. Every usable app or feature is paid. And separate bills for the same app on iPhone and Mac. Why buy the same app twice when it’s the same ecosystem?4. Battery life is okayish! It barely lasts one day now. The bundled charger is the slowest I have seen in my life. I needed to purchase an iPad charger to charge this phone. Apple intentionally specifies battery capacity in numbers.5. Cables and earphones are fragile. Already in bad shape despite careful usage.6. Price : iPhones cost a bit too much! Imagine a salaried individual putting a month’s pay into the device. Features don’t justify the MRP tag.7. Apple regularly pushes updates. But they’re buggy and break a feature or two. Patches arrive but till then you’re on your own.8. Heavy and uncomfortable to hold and use with one hand.9. Transfer of files is a pain. Even Airdrop to iPad and my colleagues’ Mac  doesn’t work often!!I agree that many android flagships are pricey. They are large and chunky.But then there’s always one available in all price brackets. Excellent free Android apps are available for all needs.I’ll move back to an Android device at next available opportunity. Never getting an iPhone again!!"
43,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,25 May 2019,varun,1.0 out of 5 stars,faulty product sent,  the phone wont turn onthis is insane
44,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,22 August 2019,Ratnesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pathetic service from Amazon,  Faulty product delivered and Amazon not giving replacement. Cheating with customer and just making money by scam and defective product delivery. Phone is not usable as display stop working randomly and screen freeze suddenly. I have provide problem video also to Amazon within 10 days of replacement but Amazon just making money and cheating with customer.
45,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,8 August 2019,Bharat Oberoi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb price thanx to amazon,"  First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear men’s size medium gloves for reference.The notch didn't bother me when using the phone for basic functions, but was annoying when watching videos; and I was a lot of videos on my phone, so that was kinda a deal breaker. It’s not that the notch bothered me by covering content, but rather the aspect ratio was based off the bottom of the notch instead of the top of the screen, so 18:9 aspect ratio videos either always had gaps around the notch, or they were cut off when zoomed to fit; 16:9 videos obviously didn’t fill the screen nicely either and made for a viewing experience closely resembling that of the older small iPhones. I also didn’t like the 18:9 aspect ratio in general as most videos I watch are still in the more common 16x9 aspect ratio.Face ID was very cool when logging into apps and websites that use password, but it wasn’t very consistent when unlocking the phone in the mornings (when half my face was shoved into a pillow and I looked like hell), when the phone was oriented sideways, or when the phone was lying on the table; ultimately, I reverted to turning off the security entirely. At that point, the notch became even more of an annoyance, since I wasn’t using Face ID; however, I did not use Touch ID on older iPhones either. With that being said, I do like Face ID better than Touch ID of previous iPhones.Another downside to the iPhone XR is the resolution. While the screen is indeed VERY nice to look at, the resolution was less that I would prefer. I would not have noticed the lower resolution of the screen if I had not been comparing it next to the iPhone 8 Plus. The problem is not with the screen itself, but that some apps had downsampled the display to 720p, instead of 1080p, which was very noticeable. I would say the iPhone XR screen is better looking than the iPhone 8 Plus in terms of producing deeper blacks and slightly better colors, and the lower resolution isn’t noticeable except for some apps as previously mentioned. Overall, the iPhone XR is and awesome but, and I recommend it, but I ended up returning it for the iPhone 8 Plus simply for the wider screen with 16:9 aspect ratio, and higher resolution.Thanx to amazon for the speedy delivery and price"

54,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,4 November 2019,Mayur,3.0 out of 5 stars,Review from an Android user,"  I am a recent convert from Android. I have used Samsung and Xiaomi phones earlier. Here is my initial impression:Pros:1. The user interface is very smooth and does not lag much even if you open multiple apps2. The battery life is excellent and I can get almost 1.5 days out of a single charge3. The phone build quality looks and feels very premium4. The camera quality is good but I have never really used smartphones for taking photos.Cons:1. Lack of customisation. I am used to customising almost every aspect of my phone and this is missing from iPhone.2. The display looks dated compared to even basic Android phones costing much less3. If you use your phone for work (email and Word), you will find several important features missing in iPhone apps. For example, I can’t change font text colour or highlight it in Gmail. Also, the keyboard does not switch to number pad when entering digits which can cause frustration, for example, when entering shopping online.4. Lack of a fingerprint scanner really sucks. I am used to answering email in the middle of the night and the face recognition does not work in the dark. I have to enter the passcode every time.Overall, I am neutral about my purchase. I got it at 43k from Amazon which is a very high price for a smartphone. I believe Android users should stick to their Android phones if they are used to customisation and good quality Amoled displays. Switch to iPhone XR only if you want a premium build and good battery life and don’t mind paying a high price for it."
55,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 June 2019,Rahul M,5.0 out of 5 stars,XR Deals seem very good,"  I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space."
56,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 July 2019,Arnab Chowdhury,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best iPhone to buy at this price.,"  Bought this phone for my wife. She's absolutely happy with the phone.After many research and comparisons and reading through different reviews decided to finally get this phone over One Plus 7 Pro. One of the major reasons is my iPhone 7. After two years of usage, that phone is still as fast as on the first day I got it.The iPhone XR is also walking on the same lines, though it's too early to say now. The XR is fast, reacts quickly and the camera sensor is real quick in capturing the images. XR is using the same configuration as XS except for a OLED screen, a second rear camera and steel back cover.Portrait mode works correctly but only that you need to show the phone a face and not any object. The front camera portrait mode works just as fins as the XS one, and as per some reviews even better.I don't see any loss of depth in colors for the LCD screen and I compared it with XS and no such visible change that I could notice with my eyes.I will update if I find any flaws with the phone. But when I'm getting all the performance hillbillies of XS except for a rear camera and at this low cost, I'm happy with the package."
57,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 October 2019,Mandeep Kumar,2.0 out of 5 stars,Got a defective screen product delivered.,  I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. There’s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phone’s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchases the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.
58,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,31 January 2020,mit z,5.0 out of 5 stars,The iPhone XR is the best iPhone to upgrade to if you own an iPhone 8 or older model.,"  In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it haven't changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you're also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that's saying something.The iPhone XR is the best iPhone to upgrade to if you own an iPhone 8 or older model. With its price dropping to Rs 60,000, this is probably the best time to buy the iPhone XR, whether you are an existing iPhone user or making the switch from an Android phone. With a phone that is full of compromises, the only real compromises that you will have to make is with low-light photography and a slightly lower resolution display. For everything else, the iPhone XR is as good as they come."

61,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 July 2019,Bharath Yadav,4.0 out of 5 stars,My First Apple iPhone,"  I’ve been using Android for close to a decade and now decided to check out iOS. Thanks to Amazon Prime Sale, got iPhone XR for a discounted price(Still expensive), Coming to the iPhone itself, after using phone for 3 days, below are the points I came across.Pros:1.Good Battery Backup(Lasts more than a day with normal day to day use).2.Single camera setup is still on par with its android siblings in terms of quality.3.Screen size is perfect (Some might feel it is bit large)4.Clean OS and App Store is having almost all apps that were available in Android ecosystem.5.Face ID is fast and accurate.6.A12 Bionic Is ultra fast and no lag whatsoever.Cons:1.Feels bit bulky.2.No Fast Charger Included (Come on Apple)3.No Home Button and getting used to gesture will take time.4.Even though Retina LCD is good, still lags behind its Android siblings. -1 here for Apple.If you don’t want to shell out more for your first iPhone(Anyway iPhones are still expensive in India), go with XR...

Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won’t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.

As we all know apple is known for its prolonged life with updates and firmwares so don't need to panic you will be up to date till 2023 without a doubt.Go for it without a doubt why should one spend 14,000 more on an 11 when this can do similar things and perform fast?"

Processer speed3. Camara quality (i won't take too many pics, I'm happy with single-lens cam)4. Battery Durability (it consumed only 3% of the battery in the past 24 hours (without sim, wifi and planemode)5. Price range (37,999)+Cons:1. for cam lovers, This is not recommended2.

Hope you will find it useful.Going by the name.. one of the best brand which you can find in the market and apple always proves it right. The phone is beast in itself. Once you will start using it you will feel the smoothness and power of iOS. Let's move to pros and cons.Pros:Inspite of having LCD display one will not notice any major difference while using the phone.Best in day light photography.Moving in and around homescreen is smooth.Face ID is awesome.Application usage feels smooth.Power of A12 bionic chip is extra ordinary.Battery being 2912 mAH performs extremely well. I got a screen time of 6 hours 30 mins with idle screen time of 2 hours while enjoying videos and games.iOS 13 is very much optimised.ConsSingle camera (Only defects human for portraits)No fast chargerLow light photography.Slight heavy and case makes it look bulkyThanks. Hope this will be useful
70,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,8 October 2019,JYO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Iphone, Sweet deal","  I was using iphone 6 since last three years before switching to Iphone XR. The following are the things that impressed me the most.1. Battery life - I had to charge my 6 every night from the first day of purchase. However XR battery is easily lasting for 2 full days with above average usage.2. Face ID - though i was skeptical about face ID, I gotta say that it is fast and cooler than Touch ID. All the apps which used touch id is now converted to face id.3. Camera - The 12 MP back and 7 MP front facing cameras are one of the best in business. I don’t kol how apple is making this magic with the cameras, Andriod phones with 48/64 MP cameras are nothing when compared to the quality of picture taken with Iphones 12 MP cams. However a software tweak from apple is mostly expected to enable portrait mode for non human subject also. Low light shooting is best and ios camera app is the best.IOS 13 - with the introduction of several cool features ios 13 has became the best operating system available in smart phones in the planet. Hats off to apple.Amazon sales  - during the Festival offers by amazon there was a huge discount in the price of iphones. I got a discount of 12K from the original price. That was an offer which i could not refuse. Thank you amazon."

72,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 August 2019,S. Chandrasekaran,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing iPhone with great offer from Amazon,"  Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update."
73,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,8 October 2019,Truth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Apple's Perfection at a premium but ....,"  Upgraded from 5s to xr after 3 years of 5s use. Purchased it at ₹37999 after low battery issues with 5s. Why I choose xr rather than iPhone 8 ,7 or even 6s even when I bought 5s after 3 years of its initial launch is1) I'm price concious (although 40000₹ doesn't reflect price concious but you will know why) and don't jump to catch latest Apple products at such a high premium price...When I purchased 5s it was approx 1/3 of initial launch price..And with xr purchase it's approx 1/2of it launch price.Although Apple slashed their prices price on box is still 76999₹ with SEP 2019 manufacturing date.2) While 5s was lauched with iOS 7 it was upgrade till iOS 12.4. 2 on SEP 2019 i.e it recieved 5 iOS generation upgrades for approximately 6 years. Now with companies struggling to sell their products as mobile market growth is slowing down I hardly think even Apple would be generous enough to upgrade iPhone 8 /7 /6s over a period of 6 years. Beside this basically these phone are selling at a price difference of 10000 -12000₹  or even less with iPhone 8 price being slightly away from my purchase price. So rather than stuck with dilemma of whether or not it will recieve updates and wasting money I decided to go for it.. AND APPLE PRODUCTS ARE ALL ABOUT  EXCELLENT SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE ( COUPLED WITH A GOOD HARDWARE).3) iPhone 8/7/6s all have a small screen size ( not talking about plus variants which come at a huge price point)a form factor not suitable for media consumption.. or playing games.4) Battery and ram are another department where this phone excels from other iphone of lower generation. With my previous iPhone 5s having 1560 mAh/1gb( hardly giving 6-8hours after mild / moderate use) ,6s with 1715 mAh/2gb ,7 with 1960 mAh /2gb and 8 with 1821 mAh /2gb.iPhone Xr comes with 2942 mAh /3gb. It now gives me atleast a day of usage with moderate use and more with mild use.These were few points that made me grab iPhone Xr at such a price point .Now this xr isn't perfect since Apple also cut few corners just to make it cheaper than other iPhone of same generation i.e iPhone X (or even lower ones.)1) Display ppi is same as iPhone 5s at 326 ppi. iPhone X has 458 ppi. But still at such low ppi display looks perfect.2)Lack of 3d touch available even on iPhone 6s.3) Charger is same as provided with iPhone 5s phone although Xr does support fast charging for which u will need to buy separately a fast charger.4)Kinda feels bulky..Maybe they could have done better..Just saying.. Accustomed of using iPhone 5s as well as 6.3 inch Asus phone with even bigger battery (4000 mAh) I must say it feels tad bulky to hold..5) Even though faceid is darn good..but somewhere I still miss fingerprint reader..as well as home button.(Just a personal preference though).I'm hoping to stuck with this model for atleast 3years or more and hope that it will not betray me either.."
74,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,25 August 2019,Kevin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hardware + Stunning software = 1 magical experience,"  Before I start this review I’ll let you know, I love the Apple brand and I’ve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said I’ll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and I’ve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone.Hardware:The phone’s frame is made of aluminum (matching the color of your phone) and is sandwiched between two glass panels, this gives the phone a premium feel. It is extremely slippery and will start to slide off a perfectly flat surface when the phone vibrates. On the front side, I love the 6.1” screen (800p resolution doesn’t bother me, as mentioned earlier). I only wish Apple would’ve used a curved screen like Samsung does. The notch doesn’t bother me at all, I got used to it in about a couple of days. The buttons are all clicky and I love the slider for the silencing the phone. The phone does not come with a 3.5mm headphone jack to lightning converter (Apple should’ve included this).Software:I’m using the latest iOS (iOS 12.4) as of writing this review and it’s really fluid. I like the gestures and the lack of the home button is nice. Everything is super smooth and nothing lags (except “endless ducker – game”). iMessage and face time are real nice apps to use and I like the fact that you can send messages with effects to apple users. I did have an issue with iMessage activation but a trip to the nearby future world solved it, on the topic of iMessage you have to pay 5 bucks to activate iMessage (just once). The App store is cool too and I like the other pre-installed apps that come with the phone. This phone should get iOS updates for at least 5 years that’s until 2023!Usage:I feel really comfortable using this phone; I got the hang of how everything works in a week or so. Don’t worry if you’re an Android user and want to switch to iOS, It is really simple. The camera (rear) is good; it takes great photos and can shoot stunning videos. I like the SLO-MO very much. The portrait mode is good, but not great (sometimes it’ll blur out your hair). The selfie camera is also good, take clear, crisp selfies. One handed use is difficult, but it doesn’t bother me much, I normally use both my hands to hold any phone above 5.5”. The air drop feature is like icing on the cake, it allows me to transfer files to other Apple devices at great speeds, and it works like magic.Final thoughts:Look, I’m by no way trying to justify the price Apple charges for their iPhones, but I am trying to tell you that this is one great phone with superb features to match the looks, which gets updates for half a decade, has excellent customer service, will get better if you have other Apple products and will get other’s attention easily. In my opinion if you’re going to spend over 50K for a smartphone and if the lifetime of the phone matters, you’ll be well off with this phone than any other android phone. As the say “If you don’t have an iPhone, you just don’t have an iPhone” (emphasis on don’t)."
75,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,24 November 2019,aayush jain,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PHONE IS GOOD, but THE OPERATING SYSTEM (ios) IS NOT!!","  Hello friends!! This is my honest review after using it for almost 2 months. I was using android since last seven years but then I decided to go for iPhone. Here are the pros and cons according to me which I have felt after using it for almost 2 monthsPROS: 😄👍1. CAMERA - 5/5 stars : camera is amazing you get amazing shots everytime. Portrait mode is so good and so is the selfie camera ..the only issue I felt in the camera was the night time photos...it’s alright it’s not bad it’s just fine and video recording is so so so good it can shoot up to 4K at 60 FPS Overall an amazing camera phone.2. BATTERY - 5/5 stars : Battery life is pretty amazing... if you’re not a heavy user you can easily make it last up to a day or even more.. battery wise no issue in this phone3. PERFORMANCE- 5/5 stars : this phone is a beast when it comes to performance ...you throw  anything at this phone it is not going to slow down... heavy games, video editing and whatnot this phone’s performance is buttery smooth.. thanks to the A12 bionic processor from Apple, it beats phone such as one plus from quite a big margin in terms of processor and performance.4. FACE UNLOCK - 4.5/5 stars : The facial recognition on this thing is insanely fast and accurate...most of the times you don’t even have to wait for it to open you just have to look at it and it instantly opens.. it is so convenient to use and perfectly secure also!CONS ☹️👎🏻1. THE iOS 13 - 1/5 stars : This current version of iOS sucks, sucks big-time ..from battery draining to device overheating to apps lagging and freezing... it has all the issues  that can ruin somebody’s experience of using iPhones, which I have to say are very very expensive ..Apple constantly tries to fix bugs by giving regular updates but it shouldn’t have happened in the first place ...at least that is what we expected from Apple ...this has been one of the most buggiest versions of the iOS so far2. MISSING FEATURES: if you come from an android phone to the iOS you are going to miss so many features. The iOS offers far less features than android does. For example, In android you have an option to share a picture as Instagram direct or as a story or to the feed whereas on the iPhone you can only share it as a post on your feed. You have to go back in Instagram to share a story or use direct messages... there is no call recording either...and many more easy to use convenient features are also missing  but you get used to it.3. DISPLAY - 3.5/5 : For all the people out there who are saying that display is very very poor and so bad ..I would like to say that display works just fine.. you are not going to notice any difference in your day to day usage..I know it is not the best display in the industry but it is pretty much usable and you’re not going to face any issues at the display front.CONCLUSION: I would have given 5 out of 5 stars to this phone but just because of the stupid and unstable and buggy iOS version, I didn’t... if they can solve issues with the iOS then this could be the best value for money phone of 2019 you can get it at for just ₹40 K which is pretty good deal for a phone like this ...apart from a few issues, this phone is simply awesome!! 😎Note : When i first bought this phone, it used to get hot or overheated, i faced the issue for about 7-8 days, and contacted the apple care for the same, they asked me wait as it was a new device and all the processes had just started... so i waited for about a week, then the issue got solved easily and automatically. But when you play games for too long or use your phone at high brightness( outdoor)  then the device may overheat."
76,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 June 2019,ashish b.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good phone, good deal","  So upgrading from 6S+ to XR. First reactions:- Camera is superb. Loving the portrait mode- interface is improved- much quicker for multitasking- Screen resolution is much improved- Better battery, lasts full day- missing the home button- missing the fingerprint sensor- face recognition has a little lag- thicker and heavier than 6S+- screen size of 6.1” is very useful- Notch feels oddOn deal/ delivery: got 10% of on HDFC cards, 4200/- for old Honor phone, 1-day delivery under prime.. so great!"
77,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,5 July 2020,Radicall21,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely great value for money with similar features compared to IPhone XS & other models prices,"  Good value compared to the IPhone XS range, but the price difference is too much to value. I upgraded from Iphone7 so I don't miss ax's model. This is definitely better than ip7. Fingerprint - 1. definitely a feature I miss, (no fingerprint feature) & Face ID definitely has few issues with Masks on faces (Covid times lol). Face ID 'Attention' feature is great!2. I have no issues with display quality, honestly I can't tell the difference but might be better than my previous one. Size is bigger but can be worked single handed.3. Battery quality/efficiency is definitely better (lasts longer). Haven't used long enough to comment on battery life/durability, that time will tell.4. Camera Quality is much better than iphone7. Can't comment about iPhone XS. Honestly none of the models had a poor camera. Only professional photographers may miss the XS camera... if at all.5. All in all, if glamour isn't your thing, & you don't mind simplicity, go for this phone since it's much better value compared to XS."
78,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,28 May 2020,Delicia L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fake product in amazon prime,  Phone shows no sim issue and iPhone support declined repair staying out of warranty issue where as the phone is still in warranty. Pathetic customer support will never purchase apple product again.iPhone service center informed its a refurbished handset sold as brand new iPhone how could amazon do such a mistake THIS phone appeared as PRIME DELIVERY product.
79,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,3 June 2019,Pavankumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Felt Android is better compared to ios,"  After transition from Android to iOS, I felt Android is more user friendly compared to iOS.Bought iPhone only to try it's charisma nothing more than that...Pros:Only Apple BrandCons:Portrait is not that great to say franklyTime consuming task using itunesNo finger printNot handy to move back from appsNot that slim mobileCharging taking atleast 2 hrs for 100%Switch off is not easierEvery time have to go settings screen to use more WiFi, location services.Literally no future for Apple until they make user friendly.Feeling very bad after purchasing."
80,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,3 November 2019,Blessed,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,"  M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i dont use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though u dont get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if u have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features...."
81,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,29 November 2019,Sobin Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Never mind the negative reviews- used review- Excellent phone.,"  I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you won’t spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing I’ve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you.In short, with apple’s latest A12 bionic chip processor and 3GB RAM this phone provides an excellent performance.Moreover, regarding to the comments that you will get a duplicate or refurbished product from Amazon, I checked with my serial number to apple’s website my phone is new and genuine. I received this product from Appario ltd nicely packed and with all seals so there’s no matter of doubt.Overall I would recommend this phone to new users, being an Apple user since 2010 this phone (iPhone XR 128GB) is another masterpiece from Apple. It has excellent battery backup as well."
82,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,25 June 2020,Pooja P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Got an original iphone delivered within a day,  So- After reading a lot of reviews about the seller- Apporio retail delivering fake/refurbished apple products I was quite worried after I had placed the order with Amazon. Though I have in the past bought 3 iphones from Amazon without a problem there were just too many comments about the retain partner. To my relief the product (it was delivered today )was authentic. I checked the Imei code on the apple website and also the warranty is mentioned in the phone in the settings option. It was delivered before the time specified so I am quite happy with the service.About the phone- I upgraded from an iphone 6- so this phone is much bulkier than the other iphones I have had. Its a heavy phone with a big screen. Rest all is as per iphone features. Battery life seems to be better than the previous phones I have had. Camera is okay. I wish I had seen the phone before ordering since its much bigger than what I expected. Its not as nice looking as the other iphones but I guess performance wise it should be okay.
83,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,9 June 2020,Pratik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review after using for 1 year,"  Phone is really amazing. It’s been nearly one year since I’m using this, and phone is very good,Built quality: 10000000/10... build quality is awesome, I was taking a video and I dropped my phone from car in speed of 160kmph and when I took it back I wasn’t expecting what I saw. Nothing happened to phone just the screen guard was In Pieces, there is just a dent on side of body and not even a single scratch to screen. Although it was the back case which saved the phone but still the phone is very tough, as nothing happened to my speakers or microphone. Both work perfect And phone too.Camera quality: 10/10... Camera is also very good, but keep in mind it has only digital zoom and photo may pixelate when you zoom, this camera is the best but only if you used it without zooming.Speed: 9/10 nothing much to say. Just sometimes some applications get laggy and then I have to close it and open again other than that’s it’s good.Face ID: 10/10 works perfect as it shouldSpeakers: 10/10 works perfect, it has got two speakers, one at the bottom and one near the receivers and both work great as it creates a stereo effect.Overall it’s 10/10"
84,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,10 August 2019,Awinash Goswami,4.0 out of 5 stars,ok,  You will always feel cheated after buying an iPhone. It will get cheaper by every next 2-3 months.It's been 4 months and I paid 17k extra considering today's price
85,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,5 February 2020,ANI,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good phone with lot of cons but still flagship,  There are many pros about this phone which you must be already aware of . I would like to point out at cons1. Screen is too small for PUBG game/ movie watching experince2. Slow motion recording is not good under artificial lighting3. Need to buy fast charger(extra bucks)4. Back glass is not scratch resistant easily scratchable if you use cheap covers.5. Too many bugs in current ios 136. Call connection problem

87,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,9 August 2020,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Quality not at all adequate as per the high prises,"  The most fraud company ever the mobile was over heating while using it,the camera quality was also not that good and the user interface is worst,And more over mostly all apps are paidIt is just the attractive advertisement and people think of it as a flagship brand don't get affected by other people thinking, it is not mandatory that everything that is expensive has to be good,so friends please don't buy until you want to waste your money."
88,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,22 August 2020,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product with additional fast charger if u uses,  Good delivery on time. For the price range of 42k  it’s really good deal everything works awesome as expected no compliance so far. Mainly changed for battery backup. When I was using Samsung note 9 hardly it will standby for me 20 hours but this phone I see battery stay for min 30 hours with my usage. I had to spend 2.5k for fast charging cable and 25w Samsung adapter to save 90 mins of charging time daily. If you’re using on box charger it will charge for 3 hrs. Using fast charger I can complete it in 90 mins from 10 to 100%

90,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,15 January 2020,wangkhem yuhen singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn't working just after 3 months of purchase.,  Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn't working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre doesn't allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3
91,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,20 June 2020,RAO ANAND,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just go for it,"  As usual iPhones are built on high quality and performance with most of the features are unique to the product, I moved from iPhone 6 to XR almost a year back, I’m very high user of device, enjoying very very positive experience till now.

95,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,23 August 2019,Rkrish,5.0 out of 5 stars,The iPhone for the masses..,"  Don’t get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If u r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,n’uff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made"

97,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,20 October 2019,Ankan Pal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome iPhone,"  I bought this iPhone XR from October Amazon Great Indian Festival at deep discount. At Rs 38000 after all discounts were applied was a WOW deal. THANK YOU Amazon.About the phone, it is one of the best from Apple stable. As an iPhone user for many years, I felt the key differences were:Positive - All day battery, which is a significant win over other models. This phone can go on for 1 full day with most heavy use. Bigger screen, which again is helpful.Negative - I felt the phone is a tad bulky or should I say, I am still getting used to a heavier & bigger iPhone :)Overall, awesome iPhone and if such deals are around, I will again go for it!"
98,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 October 2019,Spitzer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Close your eyes and go for it,"  Got it for 38k during prime early access, one of the best purchase for value of money is considered. iOS 13 future releases might make it even more snappier and battery consumption efficiency. Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario."
99,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 August 2019,Swamy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Phone,"  Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing."
100,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,23 January 2020,Alexander,4.0 out of 5 stars,Why people are so crazy about iPhone,"  I still don’t understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldn’t find much difference so for. It’s been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. That’s the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then I’ll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, that’s proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable."
101,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,24 January 2020,Its me!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good purchase,"  Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone it’s good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and it’s worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Don’t know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost it’s worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone."

103,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 August 2019,Hemang,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a BOMB!,"  need i say anything about this phone! it's a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won't find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"
104,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,13 August 2019,Balaji D. C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Product!!! Best from Apple,"  I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons...1. It’s the best ever product from Apple2. Face recognition is simply superb and works even in pitch dark conditions very rare instances of failure3. Build is good n might b bit heavy but this is to improve battery life4. Trust me I am an extensive n heavy user of the iPhone. With close to 5+ hours of screen time including gaming, social network, browsing,etc the phone battery lasts more than 24 hrs per charge5. OS needless to say iOS is the best.6. Music is a big step up here. The phone has more no of speakers n quality of sound with bass is amazingCons:1. Might seem like an android device for others but only once used can feel the difference2. Please check for price n sale times. A week after I bought the price reduced by 8.5k3. The phone doesn’t have a 3.5mm jack n hence doesn’t suite most headsets. In case u want the original headset to last for long / original headset gets spoilt the only option is a Bluetooth headset.Otherwise in simplest terms for all kind of users the best phone"
105,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,10 October 2019,Sachin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ignore the negative reviews and just go for this awesome phone,"  Received product yesterday and product looks perfectly awesome.I had booked the product on Oct 1st and received on 9th oct, in the waiting time I had gone through the reviews in Amazon and saw some negative reviews regarding face lock and camera, also some of them mentioned there won’t be any return option provided.All the worries were gone just after looking to the phone. I checked each n everything of the phone and everything is awesome.Though it has single rare camera the picture quality is awesomePortrait depth is excellent.I can say this is the only apple product which has the best Battery life."
106,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,6 June 2020,Ayan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheated on buying a Apple phone,"  I am Ayan Bhattacharya and I had purchased a I phone Xr in the month of November 2019 from Amazon.In the month of of May 2020 ( while in warranty) the receiver was not working and so I walked into a Apple service center in Nehru place . The phone was send for repair under warranty.... After a few days and after chasing the service center I got my phone back with a note that- There was a tamper being done in phone by an unauthorized person so the warranty is lapsed and you need to pay 18000 for changing it with a original Apple parts.- I made a complain and I received a call from Apple service center stating that they have found a non Apple part  inside the device. So the warranty is lapsed- I was repeatedly telling them that I had purchased the phone this was the first problem I had , why I will be going to a non service station for this. But as usual I am not being heard and I need to pay....Just to aware you all that-Don’t buy any product online from Amazon. As I feel that the tamper of my can happen over there and they had followed a customer by selling a second grade phone.- Don’t trust brand like Apple as they are selling the products online and now they completely taking no responsibility.- A non Apple parts was fitted inside a brand new phone and as a customer you will have no choice as you can’t find it.This is a pathetic state and pls do suggest how can it be taken up...."
107,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,11 August 2019,Vishal,1.0 out of 5 stars,iPhone Dead when you open the box,  Iphone not working since I opened the box. Apple support of little help.

108,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,14 October 2019,Sayantan K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lifelong Android user switched to IOS.,"  IOS:I am a lifelong android user, using android since HTC nexus. I was really doubtful if IOS can really fulfill my need like google does. and after switching, I love it. Man.. the phone is fluid. The OS amazes me, its super smooth. Those who still confused if they want to move to ios, just do it.Apple iphone XR :Well, Ive always used Longer phones like Sony Xperia Z3+ , Lg g7 thinq. This phone is a bit wide for me. It is taking time to used to with the width. And to be honest, dont go with the spec sheet. Yet it says ita 720p screen, but trst me, ive used 3k screen on Lg g7, this one is much better. Its same like a 4k tv with a crappy panel vs FHD tv with a top notch panel. Yet it says 3 gb ram, but 8Gb ram one plus have lag issues than this. Camera is as usual, Good, but not best. But low light photos are remarkable. Its good, Go for it."

110,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,2 November 2019,Ravi Kiran C R,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great battery life,"  I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it’s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory."

116,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 February 2020,PUNEESH JAIN,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Wonderful Budget iphone 📲,  It was my first iphone till date i was an android user . But believe me once you get over these phones you wont switch it awayUsing it since a few months i noticed below pros and cons :PROS :1) Battery life.  Its this phones biggest advantage as one can easily expect the juice to last for a  day and half in single charge of mild to heavy usage .2)Camera ( being a single lens it still captures perfect portraits and is doing better than many oppo and vivo phones )3)sound quality4)IOS5)loaded with many out of the box features and provides evenly and timely updatesCONS :1) screen quality it is simple Hd only not amoled or other . But it wont bother a simple user like me in a long run as the lcd is also best in terms of apple quality .2)still a bit expensive as compared to android counterparts.3)sometimes heavy gaming will cause a bit of lag that is most of the times unnoticeable.Overall verdictIts a gr88 buy if you have the budget as its an apple product it seems to last for at least 6-7 years without any hassles and the battery life is among the best on offes as compared to other products  and is good for office goers and gamers.Kudos to apple for providing timily updates and stability .
117,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 May 2020,Nalinh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic 👌👌👌!!!!,"  You will be very happy with the product display is your concern don’t worry it is awesome, it has  very accurate colours . Battery is ok. Camera and performance are top notch.If you are into iOS you will love it, but if you love big specs of android (like 8 gb ram,1080p display) you will not consider it. In an iPhone specs don’t do justice to their awesome products. End line ‘It is awesome ‘😉.  Peace ✌️"
118,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 July 2019,Mandeep,1.0 out of 5 stars,If you really looking for something good dont buy this phone.,"  Sep 2020-This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down. Theres a continuous network issue if using dual sim mode..Aug 2019 review- Its just a phone with good features, if switching from android you will love using its interface, a pure secure platform and flawless running experience."
119,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,9 October 2020,Mrid,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exchange Value!,"  Don't go for ""Exchange Value"" lolipop, its not worth it. The value for the exchanged phone given by amazon is undervalued, you can get a better deal on Cashify.com (only in selected city) and the amazon delivery guy who is also happened to be verification guy will also check your phone for any scratch or defect (like a jeweler) will reject upfront if he find any defect even a hairline and you will not get the New Phone as well even if you try to pay the balance amount. Then you have to re-order the phone once they canceled your current order. Its a hectic process for under valued exchange offer. Not sure what they expect from an old phone."
120,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,23 July 2020,Rajasekaran,2.0 out of 5 stars,Accessories issue,"  Generally I don’t prefer buying costly items online.Less guarantee on products / accessories originality.Main product have some visible serial numbers / IMEI to cross check but the accessories ???Charger adapter: Didnt work in 2 months. Got replaced as covered in warranty.Earphones Mic: Bad condition. Frequent issues.Earphones Left speaker: No sound exactly after 1 year of purchase. So could not replace also.So for costly items, don’t prefer online purchase."

Call logIPhone should update the call log featureIn this phone very few call history shows and if you call a single number for ten times in a day it shows ten times in call log just like a old feature phones and therefore the call log will be full with a few numbers.3. Call Record should be available now a daysIPhone says call record is against privacy of someone but I think today it is very important for everyone against old mentality."

123,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,10 October 2019,Sivani,4.0 out of 5 stars,Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black - Value for Money,"  I have purchased this Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black for my use.It has been more than a week since I started using Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black and the experience is quite good. I have chosen a Black color variant because it gives an executive look. I found a smooth operating system, good camera performance and a good sound quality. The important thing is the face ID which is very fast and working well in my handset. I was a bit skeptical about how to use the OTP messages and password recognition, (since this handset doesn’t have finger print unlock), but all my doubts were clarified when once I started using this handset.  The only one thing I am unhappy is the battery draining which is very fast compared to android devices. The phone is bulky, heavy and weighing more than 190 grams. We need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Except that the other features are all working well. The Amazon was very prompt in processing and delivering the Handset in scheduled time even though the festive sales were going on....."
124,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,13 November 2019,Aravind,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for Money!! True Performer!!,"  I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!!1. Superb Build2. Amazing Screen, Excellent Sunlight visibility, Great contrast and watching content on this screen or Reading is just an absolute pleasure!!!3. A12 Bionic chip is flawless!! day-to-day usage, Gaming, Multi tasking all works great.4. Being a singer, as I record songs in Karoke apps like Smule and Starmaker, recording I made thru iPhone were the best so far in the huge list of phones I used, eversince I started singing. In-Box headphones are wonderful and the Mic just works amazing. (Interested to check my recordings, please check with the ID : vindurocks, same ID for both Smule and Starmaker).5. The highlighting factor about this phone is the Battery Life. The A12 Bionic chip is such power efficient that it my phone still has atleast 40% battery left whern I reach home after work!! and thats incredible looking at the battery capacity that apple furnished in the phone. (I have my Data connection always ON, bluetooth ON and connected to Airpods, and when in Office, always connected to WI-Fi)6. Camera is Good too on this.. though not the best camera apple made, but it gets the job done for me. So no complaints on that as well!!7. Buttons are super tactile and clicky.. Ear piece is clear. Signal reception is Good as well. So its actually works well as a phone apart from all other shenanigans I mentioned earlier. So Full Marks Apple :)8. The face unlock is blazing fast and its more secure than most of the android phones out there. So no complaints for not furnishing a fingerprint reader. (after the upgrade to iOS 13.2, face unlock became much more efficient. So great job done.On a whole, even if you are a power user, this phone will suffice with all the aspects you are expecting out of a smart phone. And my sincere advise to other who are out there is, if you already own this phonne, then don't go for iphone 11.. instead, use it for 2 years and go for iPhone 12, as we are expecting some breakthrough features with the same.So this is my opinion and Kudous to apple for making this attempt in making this iPhone a Great Value For Money device."
125,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 August 2019,Vistrit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone,"  Good at 52k (the price at which I got the phone). The phone wasn’t worth 76k when it was launched but at 52k it justifies itself.Pros:iOS is very smooth and good. I am Using an iOS device for the first time but am really happy with the OSBattery life is excellent. I use to get almost 7 hrs of screen on timeDisplay is also very good. It is sub 1080p but  is an excellent panel. Comparing the other competitors in the market like S10e and Oneplus 7 pro, it's display is not as good as the others but is okayish..A12 Bionic chip is excellent. No matchBuild is soild and goodCons:Price is too high. I got it for 52k at sale but still it's quite expensive. I think 45k would have been good.Camera was overhyped by the youtubers but the camera is no match to its elder siblings.Apple is charging quite a bit of premium but still is offering a 5W slow charger:(Face ID is fast and secure but no match to a physical fingerprint scanner in terms of speed."

After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone ..go for it if you want a best experience using phone"
128,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,4 November 2019,Ravneet Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for money,  iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you don’t care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:-1) no out of the box fast charging cables. (I love using it on a wireless charger which I charge for an hour during meals)2) no fingerprint scanner - I missed it initially but the Face ID works well.3) The new gimmickry of iPhone 11 cameras such as low light photos is not available. But I can live with that knowing well I paid almost half the amount of a new iPhone 11.
129,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 November 2019,Jay,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best phones even in 2019 that can satisfy your needs,"  I got it during great Indian festival for 38,000rs. Great value for the price.Amazing display, beautiful  camera , awesome design and it's very slippery. I covered it with a case and the display gets scratched easily. So cover it with a protector too. Headsets are top class, fits perfectly.The USER INTERFACE is super simple . I got used to gestures and I'm enjoying it now.Camera: takes beautiful pictures even when in motion ! Sharp and less contrast pictures are classy !  The flash is the best !The stereo speakers are top classGives you a 3d feel or perfect stereo feeling while hearing songs !FaceTime ! Use it and iMessages !? There is nothing to beat that !Disadvantages using iphone XR !?BATTERY Charging speed : Gets charged slowly, but the entire day the battery works for you, unless you are a heavy gamer or something, like a photo editor! I wouldn't say that's a disadvantage.DESIGN:  Next, slippery hold and easily scratched display. Don't think twice to buy covers and screen protectors. Else your phone will be with dents and scratches. So you can't show off the colours of your display once it gets covered.Camera performance at night is little bit disappointing. Needs more light.Pixel 3 and iPhone 11 are better.Earphones slip when you move too fast. Again personally i don't advise or use ear phones while travelling unless necessary. So in that case, if you aren't wearing helmet or you sit in the window seat , it's a problem !I cloud storage is full in few days and if you think, google photos give free storage, then this is an issue (remember google doesn't give free storage for hdr photos)Overall, I'm new to Apple ! And this is my first ever apple product !But i feel a lot SAFER  than using pixel or any android phone.Siri seriously sucks !Google assistant is the best !Also this phone is water resistant/proof, but i haven't tested it !"
130,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,19 October 2019,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good deal for the best phone !!!!!!!!!!,"  Never thought about purchasing XR but couldn't stop myself when i saw this deal . Taken sudden decision and bought this. Very much worried till the delivery suspecting that the product would be refurbished or duplicate. But amazon kept thier commitment, i received a brand new orginal iphone.Coming from my star 5s that am using since 5 years...everything feel like magical in Xr!!i) Amazing battery life that too for an iPhone is the best feature i believeii) Butter smooth performance from ios with 3GB RAM, user interface is soo nice.iii) Super camera and professional 4k videos. You can get better outdoor macroshots in this comparing to any dslr range lesser 50kiv) Hassle free unlocking with face ID.. i was little concerned about fingerprint reader missing, but once you start using this you will understand fingerprint is outdated..all the necessary app supports face idAs my personal opinion an iphone is always an iPhone, you can never compare it with any of premium category android phones in most of the specification such as user interface, os updates, camera, life cycle  etc because instead of my 5s 2013 release, no one would be using an andorid phone of same category released in 2013.Iphone 7 and galaxy S7 came in 2016 almost with same prince range ..S7 is outdated long back and now S9 and iphone 7 are selling for same price. For sure S9 will be outdated this year and iphone 7 will be in the market atleast for 2 years!! So think wisely"
131,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,21 November 2019,aj_adtech,4.0 out of 5 stars,Peace of mind,"  Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, whats app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you wont go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ₹43000 for 128 GB variant"
132,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,7 October 2019,Shubham Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic phone upgrading from any of the previous versions specifically at the given price point,"  I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 & iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same.It has been 2 weeks since I purchased XR and I am blown away this is not just wit respect to iPhone 6 but also OnePlus 6T (another device that I have). Please find below my review on the below mentioned aspects:1. Processor and Overall Speed: XR is smooth as butter, the touch response is stunning I love the haptic touch. I am sure iPhone 11 has better speeds but XR does not lag behind in anyway whether is heavy games or basic functionality. 9/102. Camera: I love the camera though it does not the have the wide angle camera like 11 does but it does a great job. I like the portrait mode, one area wherein apple can improve the camera is introducing Night mode. Otherwise the Camera does a wonderful job (It is better than OnePlus 6T's camera) - 8/103. Cost: I got 128 GB version for 43K which is not at all a bad deal (I sold myt iPhone 6 for 7.5K effective cost is 35K). At this price point it is not short of any other premium devices in the market. iPhone 11 is for 70K for 128GB version.  10/104. Looks: The phone looks beautiful in the black. 10/105. Battery Life: After daily screen on time of more than 5 hours at the end of the day, the battery is at 30% typically which is amazing. Although it takes time to charge from 0 to 100% using the charger in the box. Waiting for Apple's fast charger to be launched in India. 10/106. iOS 13: Special mention to iOS 13 which is superb. 10/10Overall Rating: 9/10Thanks."
133,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,2 July 2020,Salman Kavish,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Budget iPhone,"  I’m writing this review after the use of 6 months. And till now I haven’t faced any kind of issue woth the product. Everything’s working absolutely good. No issues yet.Camera is good, not as compared to other X series since it’s a single lens camera. But as per single lens, it’s quite better than others, like iPhone 7 or 8.Battery back up is good.People who are seeing the reviews of issues with the display having less ppi. Believe me it’s not an issue. You won’t even find any difference."
134,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,3 June 2020,Akshay Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just love it,  This is my 3rd iPhone in 5 years having used the last two for atleast 2 - 2.5 years each.And I love the iPhone brand.Considering tht my battery life of my last phone 6S was a huge issue especially in the last few months of my use ... the iPhone battery easily lasts 30-36 hours after full charge and while using all apps.The camera is good and it is quiet sturdy.
135,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,4 July 2020,Kesang Tshering Bhutia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best iPhone at around 50k in 2020,"  I was constantly debating over whether I should get an XR or a cheaper SE or a slightly costlier 11 but I guess I took the best call. The XR is the best iPhone one can get at around this price range in 2020. The camera, performance and display are outstanding. The battery life and hardware are also better than previous models. Been using it for a month now and haven’t had any lapses in usage yet. Got a 128 GB variant for 54.9k. Worth the purchase."
136,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,6 October 2019,Sai Mukund Mathur,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the powerful iPhone!,"  iPhone XR with A12 bionic chip with 3 GB RAM is fast. This is my 1st iPhone and I am very impressed with it's performance, processing power is fast and iPhone is very easy to use and it fits in my hand very well.Face ID work excellent, it unlock the phone in less than 1 second!! Although it has 6.1 inch screen but it feels so small in hand (which is good).I also have my Samsung Galaxy S9+, now I have 1 Android and 1 iOS. Very happy !!I verified the device on Apple's website by entering the serial number to check warranty and check this is genuine phone by verifying phone's model number.

Great job Amazon!"
137,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,28 January 2020,Amit Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,"having sleek design with one camera setup, i like back side clean","  iPhone XR performs better than those specs that it showed in paper for XR.The battery is very very good and performs very well with such a small batter that is lower than 3000 mAhAfter receiving XR,  I charged it up to 100 % then used with wifi up to 4 hours continuously and then go to bed leaving battery at 65 % and wake 2 AM then updated to iOS 13 and continue using it with my home wifi till 9 AM (almost 7 hours).and leaving battery at 11 % and then I again used the internet on it and left the battery at 4 % in 40 min.And currently writing a review at lappy and phone is at 4 %.So I can say that it works 11 hours properly on a full charge.NOTE: I used it only with social apps and productivity apps and all that, I have not played any game with it in this review"
138,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 October 2019,ViralPope,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE IT !!!!!,"  I love it <3Some people are just giving bad opinions about the screen quality being a liquid retina display.All iPhones from 4,5,6,7,8, Xr and even the new iPhone 11 have same Liquid retina display and there is nothing wrong with it. Only X, Xs Max, Xs pro, 11 pro have OLED.So if you are upgrading from an older iPhone you won't even notice any difference.Don't let some poor opinions change your mind.If you like it just buy it without thinking twice."
139,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,4 October 2019,Devi Lanka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Iphone xr 128gb blue for great deal 👍🏻,"  Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues.Got this for 39k change with bank instant cashback and with exchange, amazon has given 6 months screen replacement warranty as well with valid apple warranty.. face recognition also works very fast..Cons: No 2x zoom for camera, portrait mode apart that its a great phone 👍🏻 Who wants to upgrade from 5s,se,6,6s go for this. With phone u get c type headphones, charger but not 3.5 jack as previous iphones.Pros : battery life is pretty decent it will last for 2 days.A great phone for pubg lovers as well.Portrait mode works pretty decent with different lighting modes.Overall I'm very happy with phone. Once again thanks to the seller and amazon for delivering the products as promised. 👍🏻👍🏻"
140,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,19 August 2019,Ankit t.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Amazing XR,"  Best iphone out there coming from iphone 6 , XR just blown my mind away . Below are pros n cons of the phonePros-1 . Perfect size and screen resolution. Don’t listen to those who are saying screen is bad they haven’t even seen it yet . True tone is really nice .2. Battery is beast . Best battery on an iphone even confirmed by APPLE as well .It can give you complete day on one charge on a moderate use . 7-8 hours screen on time .3 . Face id is awesome even in the dark it does not find any difficulty while recognising my face . You can login into apps using face id . So simple n smooth4 . Super performance with A12 Bionic chip and 3 gb of ram . IOS operating system is buttery smooth .5 .camera is just fantastic. Better than XS and XS max in my opinion because it uses just software for portrait mode instead of secondary camera .6 . Coral colour is just fantastic. Different colour in different lightning. Second best is white colour .Cons -1. Takes too long to charge with the charger thats come in the box . You can always buy a fast charger .2 . This phone is little bit on a bulky and heavier side as compared to other iphones due to large battery size side which is fine by me .Final verdictYou can go for it with your eyes closed . Better value for money than XS and XS max . Genuine product delivered by amazon and apario seller ."
141,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 June 2019,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,In love,"  I love this phone... especially since I wanted it for a long time... would recommend it for both apple owners and those looking to become iPhone owners...camera quality is amazing... was able to activate the esim without hazzels.. 2 reasons that I switched my old phone for...size was a concern initially since I was accustomed to only iPhone 5, SE, 6... lightning cable is a disadvantage  with this phone as the charging point n headset points are the same... but I knew it when I was getting it... so got used to it now"

143,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 August 2019,Akansha Shukla,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice phone,"  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale .  128gb - around 55kcamera -  quality is really good and better from 7 . Both front and back side camera .The colours is very original .Battery - It lasts for about 18hrs as I personally use it more for social media . GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS .Charging - it may take more time  then iPhone 7 to charge the phone (That is the draw back for this phone )Very slow charging !!!! I will personally not suggest to use other iPhone charger in this phone because there is a little problem with that .Face Unlock - It works pretty good and fast even at night when the lights is off . You may find little problem when you are using your earphone and trying to unlock the phone . It generally takes time or does not accept . Every other time either you are wearing glasses even with SUNGLASSES  it works pretty good and fast .As the size of the phone is bigger from iPhone 7 it takes a while to get comfortable with it . Accessing full phone with single hand is difficult or not possible .Gaming - I have bought 128gb phone which is very nice that too on sale . the phone doest hang on heavy games .Display - The display quality is really good specially the night and day effect , it automatically sense out the mode so its really good for eyes . It doest damage the eyes or effect them . even in low brightness you can comfortably see all apps and read the data .All over its a good device and worth a buy if you buy it on SALE ."
144,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,6 October 2019,Raunaq Roy,5.0 out of 5 stars,deal was good so value for money,"  the screen has a slight dot at the bottom which i noticed while fixing guard. If it comes out as mfr defect apple will certainly fix it. but doesn't seem serious, will take to apple while it is still in warranty to know more and update.Price is not low if you compare it with equivalent android phones, but quite good for apple product, so giving it 5*.When compared to similarly priced products:Pros:Processor.faceidcamera (might be 12mp but its much better than those who claim 48mp camera, images are real not AI type)sound (best)cons:average battery.screen resolution"
145,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,20 May 2019,Wongyal Bhutia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it,"  It's the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what's 1400 more to get the best"
146,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,11 October 2019,Ankita Jhamb,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY THE IPHONE XR AND UPDATE TO IOS 13,  iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn't have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don't show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can't solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can.
147,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,26 January 2020,stef,4.0 out of 5 stars,One time buy.,"  Got the 128 GB model since an iPhone almost always run out of space and never have the option for an SD card like Android devices.Overall there's nothing much to say about the phone itself.It is pretty much a status symbol and has little to no utility value.The camera is the sole selling point on any Apple device.There is nothing much you can do other than basic stuff like surfing the internet, watching videos, chatting and the occasional phone call.You cannot even have the option for changing the wallpaper daily!The battery life is fine if your usage is not heavy. However, don't expect it to last you for a full day.Overall it's an ok ok phone and which people would buy before going back to an Android device after 3 years."
148,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 October 2019,Sudhanshu,2.0 out of 5 stars,This phone heats up,"  I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device !"
149,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 September 2019,aditya,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall it's a beautiful phone which is having capacity to enrich your standard.,"  Their is No earpods no lightning cable or connector in that box and will call after few minutes it blanks the call,not even a bip. Kindly give me some suggestions to rectify that"
150,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,22 October 2019,Tarun Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Premium phone,  Bought it for 45k during saleBeing a single cam phone yet it manages to capture better pics than some triple & quad cam phonesBattery life sucks. You can barely manage to pull out 1 day if using your phone heavily throughout the dayUI is just awesomeSuch a smooth touch feedbackOverall a good dealMy suggestion - although black one looks classic but it just looks like any other phone. So i would suggest to go with other color choices that make your phone look different from others
151,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,2 July 2020,Aman Kumar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Read b4 buying,  There's no defective in this phn but i hv never used iphone so i wanted to use it but my first expression wasn't gud i was feeling like i wasted 60k.. It's not friendly to use.. I don't know why apple makes so complicate.. Buy iPhone only in two cases if u hv lots of money nd u want give a try then go for it nd if u want to play games then go for it.. Otherwise don't buy it.... Android is far better than this iPhone
152,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,28 December 2019,Sharad,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product is good but seller is not. Try other sellers than dusritha electronics,"  Overall the product is good from face id to Liquid retina. One thing surely standout for me is its surrounding speakers, they are really good(as per my experience), i got impressed With the work they have put in speakers. Sound is loud and clear.I, myself is a ios user and have been using them from a long time but one thing which really let me down after using it for couple of days is its CAMERA. I mean, i expected much better results from it than 8/8plus but pictures from them are more or less same with a little software improvisations. One will surely miss the wide angle lens and NIGHT MODE for this price range as they are available on every other phone in the market even in low price range. CAMERA is a bit disappointment.Apart from that, i would like to suggest everyone to DON’t buy it from DARSHITA ELECTRONICS. I have gotten a product which was imported in september and was running on ios 12 so i had to installed ios13 on it. Beside it They sent a 45k worth product in single plastic packet and while opening the package i could see the dents on the phone’s box which were clearly tellinh me, how many times this has been hurled/thrashed while commuting here and all i was hoping that it shouldnt have damaged and somehow it was undamaged inside. It infuriated me, i even trying contacting them regarding this but i didnt get any satisfactory response.PS- if you can afford 11 just go for it. :)"
153,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,9 March 2020,Review by Manish,5.0 out of 5 stars,The revolutionary smartphone that makes Apple stand out from the crowd,"  The iPhone XR is by far the best that Apple had to provide in the recent years with no doubt. Right from the camera to its horsepower battery backup, everything is top notch.And speaking of notch, the notch of the phone looks uber premium and gives a definitive all-over touch to the phone.Even while sporting an LCD display, one can never differentiate it from other models regarding the clarity and resolution. It still stands out.This review is made after using the phone for over 2 months."
154,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,11 October 2019,Srini,1.0 out of 5 stars,Display issue in 15 days- not sure whether genuine,"  Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product."
155,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 August 2019,Ramki,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best battery on an iPhone, yet!","  I am more or less stuck with the iOS platform because of the iwatch since I love its functionality. Upgraded from my 3yr old iPhone 7, was actually waiting for prices to drop post September this year  but when Amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal, I couldn’t resist!Everything on the phone works as it is supposed to, no complaints! The battery however is a BEAST, I always used to carry my power bank along with me for the iPhone 7 but i no longer need to with the XR, easily gives me an entire day of use with more than 6hr SOT and still have about 25-30% juice left! Looking forward to what ios13 brings..."

There is poor customer support since the amount of I phone XR 📱 Rs. 45k very huge.
158,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,8 August 2019,ExcitedNeurons,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Phone, can be used as Dual Sim with E-SIM","  Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very happy with the performance of the phone. Camera quality and features are the industry standard. For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com"
159,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,28 July 2019,nithin,4.0 out of 5 stars,iPhone XR review,"  First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you don’t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,”as you know glass is glass and glass will break”. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLED’s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily."
160,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,17 May 2020,Rittwick,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth buying,"  Its a good phone but definitely not worth 50k1. The camera sucks as compared to the price of the phone. Android will offer you far better quality at a very less price.2. The keyboard really irritates you as typing is not user friendly and moreover there is no separate numerical pad like android.3. No split screen like android4. Cannot copy paste an OTP. You need to scroll down the notifications bar, read and then manually type in.5. Its really a heavy phone.6. There is no inbuilt music player and the equaliser cannot be customised.7. Battery life is ok. If you are not connected with the Apple Watch then Bluetooth is off and it will run for 18 hrs with phone data on and with limited operations. With gadgets connected, not even 12 hrs.I have been using this phone for 3 months now. What i have understood is that android is by far a better option in terms of everything."
161,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 March 2020,Dan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,  Fantastic Apple phone in this price range.Almost all features are good. Camera is OK. Battery life very good. Face detection very good. Phone size is just perfect. Design very elegant.Apple as usual gives pathetic accessories. Charging is damn slow with original adapter I suggest better to use other faster travel adapter. Works perfectly with other adapter and charges quite fast. Earphone is OK. Sound quality is good but often falls off.Overall excellent Apple product.
162,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,12 November 2019,Dimple,4.0 out of 5 stars,Heavy phone with decent battery life,  I bought XR after 11 came out. I read a few articles and saw a few video reviews which said that the real difference between the phones was the camera and that it was negligible and not worth the price difference. This phone is actually quite heavy but the trade-off is that the battery life is significant.  Even with gaming and video watching the battery was fully charged will last from 9 to 7 W/O going red.
163,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,5 December 2019,Raju Kanumuri ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worst response from Amazon,"  I have received this product with manufacturing defect in it. Screen has LED bleeding problem. Contacted the service team of Apple and they are ready to replace.But the worst part is from Amazon, even though there is a replacement policy, it is use less.All the options route to Apple customer care only.You can not call the amazon customer care executive. Even if you try to call it will route you to Apple customer care only.In my opinion it is ok to use Amazon for mobile accessories but not for the Costly I phones. Better go to the stores and buy."
164,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,6 September 2020,Harkunwar Chadha,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great phone.,  I am a moderate user so at the end of the day my battery is around 60% which is good considering the battery backups of previous iPhones. Should have provided with 12watt charger instead of 5watt charger. The display is very good and iOS is buttery smooth. Free Apple TV subscription is waste as it asks for money to buy or rent movies in the app and have very limited movies and series. The Face ID is good but it doesn’t work when mask is on. They should have provided biometric unlock also as every time you have to enter 6 digit passcode which is quite frustrating. Overall nice buy with discount and bank offer.
165,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 July 2020,Abhishek Gupta 🤘🏻,3.0 out of 5 stars,Vibration motor stopped after 8-9 months😕.,"  I switched from android to iOS for the forst time and it was quite a different experience for me. The OS is very neat but not as open as of android, yes it a bit annoying at first but now I’ve  got used to it and it is normal now. One of the major issues I found was with the hardware, I mean the vibration motor suddenly stopped working one day and I was quit worried about it. I searched for solutions but didn’t find one . After some months (8-9 months) it started working automatically but, it stops every now and then. I’m not sure if I can repair it but, yes it is quite annoying."
166,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,15 November 2019,Saurabh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for Money!!,"  Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product."
167,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,20 January 2020,Amazon customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Camera is pathetic,"  I will not recommend anyone to buy XR,if you are considering iphone from camera perspective.Instead go for some other version.Really repenting, post buying this, as camera is pathetic, not expected this from iphone.Mi 6 and one plus 7 photos are superb and much better than XR.Else as a phone Iphone anyways is goodBattery life is superb,last for a day with continuous usage.Face recognition has no issue.Processing is faster."

169,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,28 October 2019,Amit,3.0 out of 5 stars,Honest and Logical Review,"  This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information.I have given my honest and genuine feedback. Now its up you to decide whether to go for this or other brand with more features but at half the price of Apples i phone Xr. Hope my review helps."
170,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 March 2020,Anikethan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best value for money iPhone,"  This is the best value for money you can get. iPhone 11 has only a marginal improvement compared to iPhone XR. But the performance is almost at par with them. I had an iPhone 6s, which ran almost 4 years. Touch and feel you get from your iphone is unparalleled with any other phone.(I have used all platforms)Screen Size: it’s a bit bigger but that’s what you get in all other phones as well these days.Processing speed: very fast, lightning, and stays like that for another four yearsCamera: professional quality guaranteed, night photos are also very good, portrait mode is amazing, beats all other android phone hands down."
171,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,19 November 2019,Samrat,3.0 out of 5 stars,Display is not good at all.,"  My Opinion-I don't know why people are saying it's an excellent display, personally i don't like the display at all, No doubt colour accuracy is good, Touch response is good, but it not that sharp, text looks blurry.Reason- So called ""Liquid Retina Display"". Guys it's just 326ppi, personally i can see the pixels, texts are not that sharp they looks little blurry.Media Consumption- Definitely it is not good for media consumption as watching YouTube videos on iPhone XR is not that great. I watch lot of YouTube videos on my phone, so in iPhone XR the quality of the video is 828p not even 1080p. Yes some people argues that it shows the option of 1080p in YouTube app, but it is not 1080p video. It can play only 828p video which is the downscale of 1080p video. If you watch a review by MKBHD, he also mentioned that ""Definitely the screen is not that sharp & it cannot 1080p videos"". He mentioned the same thing in his review video of iPhone 11 also.I personally used high quality AMOLED display made by Samsung. Samsung Note 8 Samsung S9 Plus OnePlus 6t & now i am using OnePlus 7 Pro. Yes i sold my iPhone XR within a week."

173,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,24 November 2019,sandesh goswami,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 STARS FOR PRODUCT,  I phone always like a dream phone... purchased this  in diwali sale in 38 k rs. My previous phone was s8 moved to xr and no regrates.Battery- 5/5lasts for nearly 1.5 days (screen times for everyday applications is about 9-10 hrs)Screen quality- 5/5 coming from i phone 6 and s8 there is not much difference. Lcd screen is good.Camera- 3.5/5 - if you want only camera phone than go for the higher versions of i phone. Night shots are average otherwise it is good. Potrate mode is also not available for objects.Value for money- 5/5 - Always beacause it gives you 4-5 software updates and you can use 3-4 years easily . And it is apple :-)
174,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 October 2019,Tushar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Iphone xr,"  First of all got it for 38000.  Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone.Pros:1. Great battery life: When you are not using your phone battery doesn't goes down even 1% that is phenomenal.2. A12 bionic: The processor is super quick doesn't lag at all and performance is top notch. No phone other than latest iphone can match that performance.3. Camera: great click even though it's only a single camera.4. Design: No chin and that is great. Weight of phone seems perfect when you hold it.5. Haptic vibration: It may seems a small thing but when you it comes into play it makes your experience just super fulfilling. Very satisfying vibrations and no other phone except oneplus7t has it.6. Os: super easy to use.7. Dual sim: after sometime yes iphones can be used as dual sim port but has only one sim slot other sim will be used as esim offered only by jio and airtel.Cons:1. Display: Flagship phone with no 1080p display is seriously disappointing.2. Charger: No fast charger in the box.3. Notch: Very big notch looks very bad at times.4. Single camera: It takes good photos but iphone with dual camera is just phenomenal. Camera is good but not great.Final verdict: If you hate lags, not in a hurry to charge the phone, can neglect notch and not very much into camera usage then this is the phone for you. Display is not a very big problem as its the same display of iphone8 and notch can be neglected. Now you can make your choice. But a great phone to buy"
175,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,10 October 2019,Sachin ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Want an iOS? XR is currently the best value for money by apple. Want to know how? Read completely.,"  Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern.Camera is again auspicious. It clicks the images similar to iPhone XS, the only difference you will find b/w XS and XR camera is potrait mode. XS have dual camera, hence have the capability of depth sensing and gives bokeh effect to non human objects like chair and towers, but in XR you get single camera which can snap pics with bokeh effect using ML hence only human face will be highlighted there. I personally think it’s not worth to go for XS just to click non human objects with bokeh effects. I would strongly suggest XR to everyone who is planning to get an iOS device. Its actually a value for money.Coming to performance, none of the apple competitors have yet released the chipset much powerful than A12 Bionic so just assume it to be more powerful than best android device in market."
176,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,27 June 2020,PKV,1.0 out of 5 stars,"GUYS BE CAREFUL, THEY SAY 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT BUT ONLY 1 YEAR SIMPLE WARRANTY","  GUYS BE CAREFUL, THEY SAY 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT BUT ONLY 1 YEAR SIMPLE WARRANTYI received phone on 24th June'2020 and found major voice hearing issue, spoke to Amazon to replace the phone on 27th June within 7 days as mentioned on their App but they told me to speak to Apple directly reg the issue and Apple refused to replace it, they said your phone comes under 364 warranty only and not replacement as committed on Amazon App.......................so think before you purchase on Amazon, I am still fighting and trying to replace otherwise warranty is valid for 1 year by Apple. VERY SAD AND BAD EXPERIENCE"
177,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,16 September 2019,Pratik Chaudhari,4.0 out of 5 stars,Another awesome product from Apple!,"  I've been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything's hunky-dory.While setting up the phone, you'll be asked to choose between passcode and Face ID. Choose the Face ID. It's makes your life much easier (having to punch in the passcode every single time you need to unlock the phone  is very irritating, trust me!).iPhone XR's battery lasts much longer than iPhone 8's (which I exchanged for iPhone XR). Once fully charged, the battery lasts for around 2-3 days, assuming the phone is being used for approximately 2 hours/day for activities such as browsing facebook, instagram, reading Kindle e-books, listening to music (streaming as well as downloaded), and watching YouTube videos (for a couple of minutes).The notch is an interesting design choice made by Apple. Some apps like YouTube choose to hide it, others don't. But when you take into account the edge-to-edge display, and the sleek design, the notch seems to add to the beauty of the phone.Both the front & rear cameras are good.As far iOS 12 is concerned, it's better than iOS 11. It's less buggy, and loads & runs apps smoothly."
178,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,2 October 2019,Kiran Bala,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing and Durable,  Best battery life in an iPhone.Amazing Processor A11.Privacy take care.Supports Fast charging but 5w charger in the box.Got it for ₹38k in Sale.
179,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,1 October 2019,Aman Dutt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,"  iPhone XR meets & even exceeds all my expectations in quite varied facets. XR is already been in market for a year, so instead I’ll concentrate on sharing “Amazon” experience buying it.Well, 1) Phone was delivered within 36 hours of placing order; 2) It was packed in very secure package & was handed over after I shared OTP; 3) The phone box was sealed (I wasn’t expecting this to be the case, nevertheless I’m pleasantly surprised); 4) The phone has manufacture/Import date of Sept’19 i.e current month, so Amazon is selling hot fresh inventory.To sum it all up, I couldn’t have asked for more really. Super glad with both iPhone XR and Amazon.PS: Face ID is lot more convenient than I had ever imagined, even to the extent that I find it better than having Touch ID. Camera quality is top draw & battery life -,so far so good."
180,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,10 February 2020,Sham,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome device,  Awesome cellphone i have ever used..i have switched from Android(OP) to ios..which I believe..it cannot be compared with any os we have  in market..coming to the device it’s really awesome battery on an average use last for a day..i don not play any game..I mostly spend time on Twitter and on other apps...the only worst thing i find is the charging rate which really sucks...it takes appx an hour to full juice. Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm...
181,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,15 October 2019,Ankush Gautam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not too good not too bad,"  Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem."
182,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,30 September 2019,santhanam,3.0 out of 5 stars,A premium mobile in hand,"  Thanks for Amazon for genuine product and safe delivery. Couple of month back i bought this mobile for 55,999. I am quite shock to see the reduction in price. However, The mobile works absolutely fine and truely a flagship phone. Smooth UI, Outstanding camera and average battery life.While business people who are into phone in most of the hours will feel heavy because of mobile weight (194 gm), My hands started to feel heavy during long calls and using applications. If you are not an iOS fan i would suggest Oneplus that deliver same features with less phone weight comparatively."
183,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,17 September 2019,sumalya chakraborty,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the value,"  I bought 128g  at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast.Portrait mode is working fine with perfect edge detection. PUBG freaks you can play in fully max video settingwithout any lag at all.Though the packaging was terrible only one plastic wrap was there, expected to be inside a box ."
184,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,14 October 2019,J F,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing phone at an amazing price-Go for it.,"  6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you wont get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone."

Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it doesn't even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection wont work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product."

It’s not a good deal to give 15k extra just for camera.Video quality is amazingWe can shoot amazing smooth movie like video’s.You can easily differentiate camera quality between trending 48MP and XR. It will never let u down. It’s  just 12MP but it makes miracles.@2020If u r thinking to buy Xr in 2020 Just go for it. It will outstands in every situations.@ Battery🔋 is superb ,with 15 % battery I have played Oceanhorn2 for near about 1 hour.@never seen lag@very smooth OSAnd the last@showoff😂😂😂I have CORAL and if anyone confused with coral i will say it is so beautiful.With RINGKE FUSION COVER it will make people to look again n again .&&&& the most important thing is To “be satisfied” and don’t compare with other models.Be proud that u have iPhone XR (bcos its dream of people to have iPhone)"

189,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,5 August 2019,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best option for upgrade who own Iphone 6 or 7,"  I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it's in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL."
190,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,19 February 2020,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smart Choice,  The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didn’t mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range.
191,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,18 October 2019,Sandeep,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing 😍,"  There is nothing to dislike about this phone. I forgot Android after using this. This is superior class,u ll feel it when you hold it. Don't be a sad face for 3GB Ram, it's better than 8GB Android. Facelock can recognize you in dark. There is no finger print scanner. But still it's no issues"
192,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,24 July 2019,Prateek Rai,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only satisfied but certainly did't get the best one,"  My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone."

It dont have fingerprint reader, only faceid and password.Battery backup sucks. Have to charge thrice in two days.ios is good and many improvements and features.Design is amazing.Camera is good but could be better."
194,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,29 October 2019,anirban,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,  Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. It’s incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesn’t get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing
195,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,20 August 2019,Prashu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delighted on iPhone XR 128GB White!!!,"  I just got my iPhone XR 128GB White phone. I feel am lucky to get 12% discount on MRP. In addition 10% discount on my Credit card. Also an 2% instantaneous cashback on a special day. Total paisa-vasool!!The product is brilliant and delivered right on time as promised by Prime delivery.Crossed my finger until it delivered in hand. But finally It was very neat and no damages at all. Little press marks on box which we can understand it has to travel from long distance!The phone is absolutely marvelous. Loaded with iOSv12.3 and upgrade notification for 12.4. Optimum size for viewing screen. Face reco works brilliantly. Built quality is good. I have ordered for white color, I expected Chrome on the edges, but it is mat silver finish which brought down the look. On other hand it helps in gripping the phone.!!Before buying i saw feedback on Appario Retail Private Ltd and most rated really good. Now i also give 5* rating for them.!!"
196,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,8 October 2019,AKSHAY J.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless purchasing from Amazon,  Want to return but u are not accepting it.. Bad experiance on amazon... Really paying a huge amount and giving bad quality products....
197,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,19 August 2019,Abhishek Chakravarty,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okayish,"  1.The battery life is good.2.Build quality is okay. Power button is slightly squeaky. The screen gets scratched very easily.The build quality of my iPhone 6s was better. It fell more than 2 dozen times and still standing strong and intact.3.Camera isn’t much of an upgrade from 6s (except for front camera). Night photography is not good.4.Screen is big and wide. Good for videos and reading.5.Got it for 53K for 128GB on Amazon. Great Deal!6. Sound quality is 3.75/57. LCD screen is better for my eyes than LED. I can feel the difference.Verdict-If you can’t afford XS and XS Max and want a new iPhone, then this is a good phone."

Before this XR I was using iPhone SE since from 3 years I dint had any issues wit it, but this time i just lost my money."
199,Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black,21 January 2020,Subir Gupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome phone (except the camera is average for the price),"  This phone is just awesome. Screen is really good and bright, you can’t really make a difference between the screen and an AMOLED screen. I have compared them side by side. You can’t really say the difference.Camera is average but I’m not a camera person so don’t care much about that. Although OIS is cool thing to have for my casual video recording when needed.Trust me this thing works like fluid-like smooth. It doesn’t lag and plays any game you throw at it. And not to mention the Face ID so nice. Sometimes it gets annoying a little as I was used to phones with fingerprint reader.Phone is quite bulky and will be even more when slap screen protector and cover on it. Also it thicker than normal android phones you see around these days. But it gives a nice grip for holding.Honestly if you have the budget, I don’t see any reason that might hold you back. It is great phone, and better than any other android phone that comes in this price point."
200,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),19 June 2020,ashish,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please read before buying,"  Hell man! Im a oneplus fan till i buy this mobile,Camera of this phone is completely worse before i was using oneplus 6 ,op6 camera is much better when compared with op8.....and important point to note that this phone does not even compete with my moms phone samsung a50s which is 15k rs phone.Lastly if you dont trust reviews on this,Kindly reach me out atI will provide you the originals pictures,because i have wasted 40k ...not let you guys to wasteNote: i have seen all reviews in youtube,but all will say it is bit bad .....but it is completely bad."
201,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),27 June 2020,Manpreet Singh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great but always with some screen and body issues!,"  I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5."

Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands.Camera is good, can't say it is awesome!Battery life is great too, charge too fast!UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.The back cover they provide is loose and cheap.

208,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),18 June 2020,SK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera,"  Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!"
209,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),19 June 2020,Swapnil Bhadale,1.0 out of 5 stars,Shame on you Oneplus,  With 3.5 mm jack adapter phone not giving any sound I tested many earphones but it does not work shame on you Oneplus
210,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),21 June 2020,Vikas Shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,best and most reliable phone at this price,"  I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5.1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing.2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging.3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth.4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing.5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins.6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear.7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good.Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple.I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future."
211,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),17 June 2020,Prasad G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Iconic but Camera could have been even better,"  I have been using One Plus 8, 6GB RAM, 128 GB version for past two days. I bought this phone at 39,999(2K discount with SBI CC). I was bit skeptcial before i bought this phone as i was planning to buy the PRO version, but i do not regret anymore :)This is my first encounter with luxury segment and believe me it's amazing.Truly iconic experience. It's a master piece in terms of performance. works at lightning speed, face detection is utterly smooth, finger print sensor on the screen works like a charm.Very smooth display(90 hz). You will see a notable difference from 60 Hz phones available out in the market.Built in Alexa capability, ofcourse you have to install the app from Play store.Camera is really good when the object is closer and detail is lost to some extent for distant objects. It could have been better at this price segment, but then no complaints.Final verdict: Just close your eyes and buy it if you are looking for a ultra smooth experience and nice looking smartphone and you may not be fully satisfied if you are looking for a Camera phone matching with Apple standards."

Noted some lags.3. Camera quality is below average in this price range.4. Battery performance is also OK only.
213,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),19 June 2020,Himanshu Chaudhary,2.0 out of 5 stars,Camera not upto the mark.,  Front camera is really bad with the latest update. It takes blurry photos and night performance is also bad. I am thinking to return it as back camera is also not that good. My realme was doing better job in camera department. Phone is smooth as you can expect from one plus oxygen OS. It seems like one plus launched half cooked phone.

216,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),23 June 2020,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful Amoled Screen,  Display which takes the major chunk of ur attention is awful. At low brightnes settings flickering of white texts are visible... In low brightness videos that are shot in dark situations are just invisible. Was watching Expanse in my oneplus 6t before switching to 8. Basically in low brightnes the series is unwatchable in the 8. Every other issue like average camera I can live with. Unlesss oneplus pushes some update before my return time expires I am returning this junk.

227,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),2 August 2020,musa kharbe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Phone!,"  Some people are comparing Oneplus 8  with Onplus Nord. In case you are confuse and you have the budget please go for this one for following reasons:1.Oneplus nord has cheap plastic frame. This one has aluminum. Build quality is superb and premium.2. Nord has 8mp wide angle camera this one has 16mp which rocks3. Nord doesn't have stereo speakers. The speaker on plus 8 are stereos with dolby support.4. Nord has UFS 2.1 vs Oneplus has UFS 3.05. Nord has ugly dual camera holes in front compared to oneplus 8 having single punch hole6. The most significant difference is a flagship processor. Nothing can beat snapdragon 865. Nord has mid range processor. This one is a beast7. Although the resolution and refresh rate is same. Nord has a low quality display while  oneplus has used samsung Amoled panel with eye care certification in oneplus 8.8. Curved display is premium feature which looks good you don't get that in Nord. It make phone easy to hold as well9. Oneplus 8 supports usb type C3.0 vs nord has slower type C 2.010. Although both Nord and oneplus 8 are not officially waterproof, oneplus 8 is actually some waterproof without certification.11. Nord is not future proof due to performance this one can last you atleast 3 year Snapdragon 865 is not a joke"

244,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),7 September 2020,Vachancr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Checks all the boxes.,"  ZERO REGRETS.I was a little bit skeptical before buying this. Made a lot research,saw almost all the videos on OnePlus 8 on YouTube and read pretty much every review written on Amazon and all other online articles.After using this phone for precisely 15 days I HAVE 0 REGRETS .1.Awesome Build quality .Sleek and sturdy in hand. That finish on the back is an absolute beauty.sort of gives a matte finish but with a smooth touch.Love the Galcial green colour.Gives a bit of teal colour when you change the angle of view.2.DISPLAY is Gorgeousss.10/10 put a HD+ wallpaper and you won't stop looking at it.3.Battery life 9/10 just because i expected it to be even better than it already is.Easily runs a day on a single charge with 1 hour of gaming and scrolling social media. Battery charges faster from 0%-90%(50 minutes) but takes a little bit more time to reach from 90 to 100.4.OS and UI is fast.It's a breeze and no hangs or lags anywhere. 10/105.Fingerprint has no complaints along with Face unlock.10/106.Saw a lot of negative reviews on Camera and this is not really my area i do not take much photos on my phone but on the few photos i have taken i am really happy with the outcome and really to the general public the pictures look good.I am not sure what the Tech reviewers expect a smartphone camera to do.Overall it's a gem of a phone you won't stop admiring the beauty and UX of this phone.Gaming is a breeze a lot of pubg(4 hours on the bounce no lags but heats up a little at 90fps but otherwise no complaints if you play at a low settings.Worth every penny. You won't feel like you have given more money for a less awesome experience.GO FOR IT.Not a paid review or anything,genuine review coz i know how confused we get before buying a phone from a lot of options especially at this price. Trust me I spent almost a month on research before deciding on this ."
245,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),14 July 2020,ATUL,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very very very very poor quality front camera.,"  I switched from Iphone to android just for oneplus speed, screen, amd camera as they claim but in oneplus 8 the front camera is so so poor that I regret of having bought this phone and felt that my money got wasted. The Iphone 6 has 1.2MP front camera and oneplus 8 has 16MP and you know the winner obviously Iphone 6, so I want to ask you oneplus why do you claim to compete with Apple when your 16MP camera cannot even withstand infront of 1.2MP of iphone 6. After seeing the poor quality of this phone I want to ask one more queation to oneplus why did you switch from pop up to punch hole.So to all the oneplus lovers please do not buy oneplus 8 my true reviews, you must be excited to buy after having watched videos on youtube but the truth is oneplus 8 is not worth of what they claim to be expert in this field and ahead of everyone in the market. So wake up oneplus and go and see the world because you have not really seen it."

For hardcore gamers I think Iqoo 3 will be a better option but if you are looking for a phone with premium look and performance both and camera dosent mater too much then defiantly one plus 8 is one of the best options available in market at present."

Actually this is placed for my brother-in-law and after the delivery, he has complained about the battery which drains very quickly. I suggested him, wait for 2 more days and take a call on it whether a defective piece or not, which needs to be replaced. After 2 days surprisingly the battery is stabilized and works well. The following are best on the phone1. The screen is very good2. The PUBG game is very smooth3.  It catches Networks batter than most of the mobiles.4.  Camera is good5. No heating no lagging issues6. Fast charge is awesome7. Multi-tasking everything is good Cons1. I am not happy with the camera at this price, the quality of the camera is almost like my Samsung Galaxy A51 Camera."

Here are my views....Great display with punching colours. I'm loving the curved screen and I'm not getting any accidental palm touches as the curve is very minimal.Love the speakers and the sweet haptic feedback.The weight is unnoticable and it's good to hold it.The OS is awesome and I switched from MIUI.The only problem is the software has one or two glitches. But they are being solved one by one.So to put it out there the phone is a BADASS.The only drawback

If I knew beforehand this is why ONE PLUS offers WARP CHARGING so that no one complaints because we offer fast charging.I would have never bought this phone.I know there is no comparison with Xiaomi but my RS 16999 MI ,used to work 10x better. Please save some money from Influential marketing and get a good technical team who can work on backup. I pitty my purchase decision literally waited for its delivery day and night . At this point I need a new replacement. Delivered on 15th August but works like a one year old phone in terms of battery life and performance. You guys killed my excitement."

Please don't buy OnePlus 8.Worst issue I face is that the device stops receiving network signals once in 4 to 5 days. Only rebooting the phone gets me out of the problem temporarily. Worst part is I never know when my phone will stop receiving signals. I've missed many important calls.Camera is worst for a 42K phone. Front camera is worst.Fingerprint sensor has problem in detection. There is delay as well as it doesn't recognise the edges.Finally no matter how long you wait to speak to the OnePlus customer care, they never respond. Is this how a reputed company treats their customers?I don't even know if sending the phone for service helps. Or I should wait for updates."

It's smooth os, classy look, eye catching screen quality. The camera quality is awesome. For a non gaming, casual user like it's a performer.. Video quality is o top notch. If your budget is above 30k go for OnePlus devices. Moreover I also use their bullets, backcase, otg everything. Felt satisfied."
258,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),14 July 2020,Shahidkhan pathan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review after 10 days use,"  So starting from design and talking about some cons and pros of this beast.The design is very stunning and brilliant than more premium phones,the battery backup is very much of good and as I am a pubg player I use to play 4 hrs continuously without any lag,heating issue & battery drain issue i.e battery backup is pretty worth.Comes to processor it is most speedy device I have ever seen previously I was using on of oneplus flagship device and also tried asus rog 2 but this is much more faster.Lastly comes to camera if u are camera holic don't even think to buy this phone my friend has nokia which worth rs 9k and I found camera quality of that phone is much better in comparison to this device horrible camera quality nightscape pictures look blurry and ultra wide angle is just like zoomout option and selfie looks like cheaper version of vivo another disadvantage is brightness you have to make your brightness full in normal daylight and night mode or reading mode is not that powerful as previous phone."
259,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),22 August 2020,Ankur Phogat,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a hotshot,  Overall product is stunning1. Design- Curve design adds on to the overall design. Product is very sleek and appealing.2. Screen - One of the best I HV ever witnessed.3. Battery- Charges with a booooosttttt and good backup for 1 or 1.5days as per your usage.4. Speakers- Forget your Bluetooth speakers and you'll absolutely love this double speaker setup.5. Vibration- The phone got best of the best vibration mortor in it and you'll realize it once you're gonna use it.5. Camera- Not a high flying one but yeah a descent one and screen quality adds on the kind of experience you get while viewing images.6. Colour- Glacial green is again love it or hate it one but definitely you'll love that matte glass on its back.7. Cover- Very attractive cover but turns brown within 25days so as the case with other transparent covers.8. Definitely Chinese- Consider it too😅😅
260,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),5 July 2020,Sumanta Ghosh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Flagship at present around 40000/-(6GB|128GB),"  1. 6GB /128GB variant is the best value for money. If a bank discount and cashback is available then that shall be an icing on the cake. At a price range of 39000/- to 40000/- this is a best bet as there is no other competition to the one plus 8 in market at present.2. Asthetic built quality, very nice in hand feel which can be easily noticed while holding the unit in hand. This is a practical size 6.55” screen which can fit in the pockets of trousers or jeans. Light weight (180 gms) and ergonomic design make it user friendly and comfortable to hold. Weight balance is excellent and feels premium in hands.3. Glacial green colour to me is the best bet. Looks premium, anti-finger print.4. Curved screen is not that much and i am not facing any accidental touch issues rather the curved screen adds to its premiumness.5. Camera quality is decent but shall not satisfy camera enthusiasts. One plus needs to push camera updtaes to make front camera more accurate.6. Latest processor Snapdragon 865 is a breeze to use and lightening fast. Even though it is not 120 Hz there is not much visible difference which can be spotted between 90Hz and 120Hz. Over all screen performance is brilliant. A big thumps up for the beautiful super amoled display.7. Battery is very good. Last more than a day easily on heavy usage too. Screen on time is around 7 to 7.30 hours in normal use.7. Best Flagship at present around 40000/-(6GB |128GB).My Ratings :Built quality, weight balance & design : 10/10 ( Brilliant)In hand feel : 10/10 ( Awesome )Screen quality : 9/10 ( it’s FHD and not QHD so 1 mark less)Battery life : 8.5/10 (Very Good)Performance: 10/10 (Awesome with QSD 865)Camera : 7/10 ( Average )Call quality : 10/10 (Impressive)Speakers /10/10 (Best in class)Gaming : 10/10 ( awesome)Heating issues : Nothing abnormalConclusion :Go for the 6/128 GB variant which is best value for money."

262,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),2 July 2020,nitesh shukla,2.0 out of 5 stars,bad software optimization,"  Not good if you spend 40K on something, then you will hope that the product will be good. I bought this phone at 20th june and am having trouble with it. Because of being expensive, I was hoping that there would be no problem in the phone But there are some bugs that are not resolving even after resetting the phone(espacially related to calling- which we can't fix)"

265,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),28 July 2020,Sagnik Sarkar,5.0 out of 5 stars,The truth about OnePlus 8,"  I have been using this device for more than a month now. First let's talk about the Pros.Pros:1. Oxygen OS - If you're an exisiting OnePlus user then you'll be quite familiar with the user friendly and bloatware free experience Oxygen OS has to offer. If not you're in for a treat.2. Screen quality - This phone has one of the best display to offer in this price segment. Yes some people might not like the curve but take my word for it 4k/FHD videos will take you to another viewing level experience when it comes to OnePlus 8's Fluid Amoled display.3. Battery life - I am a heavy user but still the phone provides me with a full day battery support if I keep it on overnight charging and start the day with 100% battery in my bank. You'll find it very hard to drain this phone's battery to 0 even with heavy usage.5. Performance - Now coming to the big boy's playground. This phone will provide you with a blazing fast and snappy experience in day to day use. High end games,multiple apps open in the background,video rendering you throw anything and everything to it and it will pass with flying colours. The RAM management is also pretty well optimized.6. Build quaity - The in hand experience is something I liked a lot. You'll feel that you're holding a premium smartphone in your hand. It fits perfectly in your palm and you'll be able to use it even with one hand.Cons:1. Camera - The only con I can think of is the camera and that's only because of the infamous 2MP macro camera. It's a gimmick. But tbh the camera performance of this device is no less than a flagship if you consider the primary camera and the wide angle lens. The image processing has been done brilliantly and after a couple of software updates the pictures started turning out brilliant. Good dynamic range and colour reproduction. Since it has OIS videos are not shaky at all. If OnePlus is able to produce good quality images with the 2MP macro lens with some software update then it would be the icing on the cake.Final verdict:OnePlus 8 is an excellent smartphone and if you're looking for that flagship experience and you don't want to spend those extra bucks for IP rating,Wireless charging and a Telephoto lens then ditch it's big brother and go for the OnePlus 8. You won't be disappointed."
266,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),17 July 2020,Ashwani ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Honest review after 1 month usage,  🔋- no no doubt it works all day if you play pubg although it get heated in HDR extreme but you can use it for all day...Screen  time it take near to 7 to 8hrcamera quality-camera quality in day time is very good and it is very sharp also and the camera quality in night time is also good macro lens although it is usable for some nearer photoVideo quality was superb optical stabilizationScreen quality-no login screen 90 hz super smooth super amoled screen just gonna love it for the first time.DisadvantageSometimes Google Chrome and whats WhatsApp stops automatically show legging.
267,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),17 August 2020,Joe Thomas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Phone,"  I was using one plus 5t since 2018. No issues till date. So I decided to upgrade to one plus 8. Before purchase I heard a lot of negative reviews from youtube and Amazon customer feedbacks. But I didn't backward, I trust one plus. And I purchased one plus 8 on 7th Aug and got in hands on 10 th Aug as they promised. I got this for 37k on Amazon Prime Day deal and MFD of phone is 06 2020.I checked everything. The camera, screen quantity, heating issue etc. Based on that I am reviewing the phone. Every thing is good except camera. Iam not saying the camera is bad but The camera could be better. Hoping one plus will solve the issue on next software update.One more thing I have to share that there is having heating issue while playing pubg for more than 1 hour in 90hrz. I am not a pubg player. I have to test the phone. That's why I played pubg. If you are not a pubg player you will love this phone. Iam sure one plus will improve this phone with software update. If you have budget for 41k phone I suggest this one is worth."
268,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),11 July 2020,Manish Anand,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb, Camera could have been better.","  I remember I was one of the early buyers, bought the phone on the first day of sell. Writing the review after using a month, I would say screen quality and battery life are superb. For camera I would give 4/5. Although we don't get wireless charging with it but with 30w warp charger the phone gets charged in no time. SD 865 will not give you a chance to complain about the performance. Premium design,feels smooth, bit slippery if you don't use any cover. The phone comes with 5G, we are not talking about 5G in India now but you never know in a year or so. Overall experience has been excellent."

270,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),29 August 2020,Fazil Muhammed,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed and feeling sad !,"  Bought this phone with huge expectations, but turned out to be a below average phone for the price. Major issue is with the display, for which both saturation and contrast levels are poorly calibrated. Whites are super white and darks are pitch black, and color reproduction is way off the mark. Camera too is disappointing. A 20k phone captures better photos than this. Also there is some issue with the video quality when viewed at 420p in YouTube. The clarity and sharpness of video at 420p looks like 240p in other phones. Overall highly disappointed, hope all these are software issues which will get fixed overtime"
271,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),12 August 2020,Mr.kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,This the best mobilephone that I have.,   I am using this phone since last 2 days and I'm very happy with it.Previously before buying it I was very confused that what to buy so I have searched a lot since 1 month but almost everywhere I get to see that camera is not good as perious OnePlus phone but now I'm using it and it is very satisfying you can definately go for it.And in above image I have shared screenshot of battery life.So averall you can go for it without thinking for any pros and cons.I have added few pic shot on this phone.😁😁😁
272,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),2 July 2020,MS,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sort of an Average phone,"  This review is based solely on comparisons with my previous phone the Galaxy S8.Having used S8, this phone feels sort of a step down or more appropriately just a continuation of the features on S8. Given that the S8 was released more than 3 years back, there is no significant advantage of this phone mainly when it comes to software. Or probably it's just my opinion after getting used to the myriad of software tweaks and options that Samsung provided.Even with a 6gb ram, and with only 3-4 apps running in bg, lots of the apps like chrome, prime video, youtube etc still freeze up sometimes and you have to close and re-open the app. This is something I never faced on my other phones before. This proves the OS is not very good at memory management.This has triple camera, but the macro camera is just a waste of space added solely so that One plus can claim they offer a triple camera setup. The camera feels severely limited in the software field.Design is quite good but again it's nothing that I have not experienced before. The 2mp camera reminds me of my sony erricsson k series phones which was like 10 years back.Weird flickering when scrolling through dark themed pages mostly with night mode on.Speaking of night mode, it is an absolute joke. If it has been applied, when you turn on the display, brightness is normal without any night mode filter which will initially hurt your eyes in the dark(if it's not dark can't see why anyone would use night mode), then gradually the filter would start to apply over the screen. Now some one plus fans find this gradual application cool, but honestly it will just hurt your eyes with the initial high level of brightness in a dark room.Speed is awesome with the new Snapdragon processor and 90hz screen refresh rate.(if you ignore the application freeze issue)Battery Life is okay.Phone just doesn't feel as smooth as even older samsung s series or iphone. It just leaves a lot to be desired on the software front particularly if you are stepping down from an Apple or a Samsung flagship.If you have the budget, then go for some other flagship or the 8 pro if, hopefully, it does not have the same performance glitches."

274,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),19 July 2020,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great i hand feel...a true beauty.,  Well after using one plus 8 6GB variant for 20 days i am writing this review. In a crisp and short version...it is great phone if you are looking for a sleek sexy Device with flagship processor and clean OS. Updates are on time already had 2 updates by now.Primary camera is great and deapth is also great. They tske very clear shots even in lowlight. Nightscape works well but with flash also it takes perfect shots. Macro is nice but only in day light or good lighting condition.If you are Camera geek then also it is a nice phone for you except rhe Macro part...telephoto he de dete to acha hota.Day to day usage ram management is great.Battery life is more than 24 Hours if you are medium usage person. And upto 14-16 hours if you play a lot of PUBG on it. I have already accidentally dropped it and not a single scratch or damage to body.In short loving this phone for all the great package at a good price.

277,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),16 August 2020,Saurav K Singh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Please buy something else,"  TL;DR Not at all satisfied with this product. I won't recommend buying this phone.Battery life: This is the only satisfactory part of the phone. Screen time of 5+ hrs including gaming sessions, 6+ hrs without gaming.Screen Quality: Very average. If you have used any quad HD panel in Samsung or an apple device, you will pity the display. Color reproduction is very poor, even after calibrating the display. 90 hz is of no use if the panel itself is so lifeless.Camera Quality: My OnePlus 6T has takes way better photos than this one. Big disappointment here, both front and back.Performance is good, the chipset is fast as expected. Modem, BT has good connectivity.Sound is good with Dolby enabled stereo speakers. Volume level is good too.All in all, its a big failure as a flagship phone. Wasted my 45k. Tried to return but Amazon says we don't accept returns and replacements can't be done on the basis of Quality."

I came from a 6t to the OnePlus 8  and this issue has been bullying me from the moment I swapped my sim to the brand new OnePlus 8 .When comparing overall network performance, my 6t was way faster while being as stable as can be. This cannot be said for the OnePlus 8 ; I have to reboot my phone MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY in order to get any network back (only to see missed calls, again).The 6t never needed a reboot for anything."
280,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),10 July 2020,sahith v.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dissapointing flagship,  Performance wise it's a beast. Disappointed with camera.Micro camera is utter waste . Portrait also fades the image quality.Indoor photo quality is not great. I personally don't get the flagship feel although flagship features are present. Pubg is very smooth . Battery is okay.Should have provided other colours for 6gb version bcz some of them won't like green. Case provided is absolutely waste. Becomes yellow in 2 days . Call quality is best and microphone performs very good. Brightness is eye catchy but becomes difficult at night. Phone freezes a lot which is very irritating and loading gallery takes long time . Phone gets laggy while using Chrome YouTube or any scrolling apps

282,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),14 August 2020,Pranav ps,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review after 2 months use,"  Brought it after a lot of research and now I'm writing this review after using the phone for about 2 months now. Let me get the cons out first, the macro fan is completely unnecessary and is of low quality. That's it! Rest everything is just fantastic!!! pros-++Most people don't give much thought for the actual build, premium in-hand feel, sleekness etc but those actually make a lot of difference and for this phone, all those are top notch.++Display is vibrant & clear, performance due to top specs and oxygen os is on a different level.++ primary, front and side angle cams are good.++ Matured and class look. Compared to this, some other phones I looked into in this segment and below seemed cheap and bulky.++ Regular updates and the OS with enough add-ons but not too much.++ Lightweight++ Good battery backup++ Good gaming capabilities, and a dedicated gaming mode. I don't use my phone as my primary gaming device, but for such people too this phone is more than enough.Final thoughts-- just go for it! Could've priced a tad lesser, but considering the competition this is just all round better!"

285,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),22 June 2020,Neoharys,4.0 out of 5 stars,The OnePlus 8,"  The phone is definitely great. The battery life is amazing and feels amazing in your hands. It is kinda narrower, I prefer thick wide displays though didn't faced any issues. The first thing I noticed is that phone heats up, after updating and downloading essential services the heat up issues were resolved. The camera quality is really good too, I have seen many reviewers trash them for the price (in Indian varients it's definitely worth the money). The phone is assembled in India which does gives Indian economy a slight boast, but if you can afford a better phone from samsung go for it. The telephoto being absent doesn't even makes any difference, the 2X digital zoom is just as good. The Macro lens is weird and has a circular blur around it, but is usable. The updates will make phone better I'm sure of it. This was my first premium phone after a 5 year old budget one.I'm sharing the camera samples, please don't mind the background. I've shot with all the lens, including the 2X digital zoom."

293,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),28 June 2020,Srinjan saha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Performance Beast and Bang for buck.,"  The device with the best performance. Absolutely in love with the magic of oxygen OS. Camera is not the best, but not bad either(suffers in low light). Display is sharp, bright enough, and 90hz is the champ factor. No display issues like green tint, black bar. Battery backup is the best thing about this phone, consistently getting 7+ hours of SOT on 90hz. Definitely worth the money and better option than the Oneplus 8 pro, as neither of them have flagship grade cameras (still a long way to go for Op in camera dept).In depth camera review - Selfie 8.5/10, main camera 8/10 , ultrawide 8/10, macro 3/10 , night mode 7/10 , colors 9/10, dynamic range 9.5/10, sharpness 8/10, details 10/10, exposure 7/10.Overall experience of using the phone - 9.5/10I'm happy that I switched from my S9 plus to this device, as performance is what matters to me and the majority of the users. Exquisite cameras are just luxuries which is only there on iPhones, Samsung devices."

Security is not like other Chinese brands so you can trust OnePlus. I only have complain about the camera only but I guess it can be better through a software update. Overall very good product and beleive me you will love to use it and I am happy with the purchase. Keep it up OnePlus."

And this is my first One plus phone.Pros:1. The first plus point is its Oxygen OS. Before this mobile I was using Stock Android based mobile. I'm really happy with the OS.2. Charging is super fast with 30 watt charger. 100% charging in less than 50 mins3. The screen touch with 90hz is like a velvet feel4. Camera is good, but not the best. But, this will fulfill most of camera usage.Cons:1. Missing Telephoto lens for this budget.2. OP8 can be made more budget friendly by launching only 4G supportive device.

It's fast and snappy performance with 90hz display is the best.Battery is decent and with heavy usage I get one days worth.The only lacking thing in this phone is the camera and if you do want a good camera phone go for the Samsung s10 lite. Other than that i have had no issues. It would have been better if they had given a headphone jack, but nonetheless this was a compromise I was ready to make.P.S: Download Gcam for a better camera experience. The first picture is taken from Gcam and the second from stock camera."
299,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),28 August 2020,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad...waste of money,  Battery back up is very bad.Not satisfied with battery work.I doubt the phone I received is not original piece.To whom it may concern make sure the phone you are ordering is new one...as there is no proof that it is a already used phone sent again or original oneNot feeling like a new mobile which I got.
300,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),20 August 2020,Manadeep Ganguli,5.0 out of 5 stars,Feels good to hold an OnePlus,"  At a 40k pricepoint, getting an OnePlus device with top of the line configuration for an average user, is indeed a 5 star worthy of a product.Pros:Screen qualityStereo speaker (Dolby Atmos)90Hz refresh rateBattery backupSound quality (go to equalizer settings and auto tune to your liking to get the best output)Processing speed (games, browsing, app launch)OxygenOS (lol)Cons:Average camera for the pricepoint (insta would-be influencers might cry over the quality)Qhd screen should have been givenDdr5 ram missingOverall, go for the 6/8gb ram model, should serve the purpose well enough."

303,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),24 June 2020,Sunny Baidya,5.0 out of 5 stars,A new beast to play with.,"  It's expensive. But the device is fabulous. Sound quality is osm. Display quality perfect. Battery is okay. But charging is dam fast. So all over everything is fine. But, as you know there is always a but, I'm not happy with the camera, front camera is perfect but back camera is not to the mark as claimed by the company. And macro lens is a total waste. But gaming is fabulous. No lag issue, no frame drop. But as many people says in youtube about this mobile they bluff ya, mobile does get hit up, while charging also and while playing game also."

MANY PHONES PROVIDE SAME FEATURES FOR MUCH LESS THAN THIS! if os matters go for it!

306,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),3 July 2020,Madhu Mathew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing and stylish device from Oneplus 😍,"  Amazing device and it's easily manageable in one hand. Camera is just average but not so bad.I compared this with the 7T and quality is much better than 7T and better color accuracy in all the lenses. Battery backup is great and easily lasts for a day.Snapdragon 865 is just amazing 🔥 to play call of duty and pubg, i really didn't feel any lag or anything, when you play it when 90Hz refresh rate it becomes more smootherWarp charge 30T charges the device in one hour and ten minutes which is pretty good considering the battery capacity.📷 We miss the telephoto lens from 7T but when you zoom in the quality is same. Macro camera lacks details because it's just 2MP (I don't really use it that much).Overall an amazing device which is sleek and stylish. If you buy oneplus wireless z when this device the audio quality is pretty close to the wired oneplus earphone. Oxygen OS have many features that other os lacks. If you want a sleek device with amazing display quality and good cameras go for this one.I definitely think choosing oneplus 8 than 7t is the best option considering the price and specs. It's in hand feel is just amazing experience 😍😍😍😍"
307,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),5 July 2020,Sudhanshu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Completely contended with phone,  I used this phone more than two weeks and i personally opine that it's worth for 40kIf you're thinking to play game or clicking picture this is the best option you can buy. Curved display give it a premium look . I chose it over pro due to the fact that there is a big money gap between them and it has almost similar features.
308,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),27 July 2020,ANANDHU VIJAYAKUMAR,5.0 out of 5 stars,User review after 1 month,"  I like this phone very well. It's screen is maintain a flagship quality under all lighting conditions.-Battery performance is average. Don't expect more from this device. I got 6 hours screen on time for an extreme use.-Camera performance is predominant in good lights conditions especially on day lights. But night photography is not hit the level that I expected from this device.- Video performance is nothing to say, it's predominant!!!- Fast charging as well.- I face only one problem from this device that, it's ram boost function in settings is not worked well. Sometimes especially when I using whatsapp, the application is automatically closed during typings. It's may be due to enabling the function ""Ram boost "" in settings. May be they will solved it by next updates.-90Hz is awesome, but it's drain battery very fastly. I got 5hr screen on time during my normal usage.( Instagram, pubg, YouTube, movies, fb)- Gaming mode is also good. I can easily play ping without any lag. We can expect a better gaming performance from this flagship processor. SD 865-Oneoverall I give 9.5 out of 10 for this device"
309,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),25 August 2020,Parmvir Singh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Display stop functioning and blacked out.,  I bought this phone 2 months back. It's almost good.

310,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),25 August 2020,Muneet kaur,1.0 out of 5 stars,Camera is blurry,"  My one plus 8 camera gives blurry images. The image will appear to take a long time to lock focus on the screen. It also takes a lot longer to capture HDR images. It is really worthless to buy such a costly product to waste money from Amazon.I am very very disappointed with this product from oneplus & wish to be getting it replaced. Had a word with the customer agent SIDAR she has assigned a technician on 25th august. The technician details are attached in the screenshot below. He came and he checked the camera and clicked some pictures. He himself wrote a report and showed to us in which it was written that ""Camera is blurry"".Now, I again called them to ask for further procedure for replacement, they said another technician will come on 28th August and the amazon technician assumed that the camera is perfectly fine. How do i trust your technicians who says something and gives a different version to amazon experts. Poor service Amazon as I have always been a loyal prime member."
311,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),13 July 2020,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great features but pathetic display,"  Being a one plus fan, I was very much excited about this device. The performance of the device is no doubt a beast but the device is facing a serious display issue.When the brightness is set to very low on the display the complete shadow of the fingerprint sensor is visible. I have attached the photos for reference. When you pay such a premium for a device you do not expect such a poor quality display. I think Oneplus should address this issue and come with a proper answer.Apart from display issue the phone is tremendous in each and every aspect though the camera might be a hit or a miss.I had to replace my device once and then opt for a refund as this issue was something way big for me. The display is something you directly interact with and if it is faulty then your complete experience is ruined.So in my opinion it will be more of a lottery like feeling if you can get a perfectly good phone.At last, dividing my review in pros and cons:PROS:-1) Great gaming and day to day performance.2) The dolby atmos enabled speaker is a joy to listen.3) The battery can easily last the whole day at 90 hz ( over 6 hrs of sot)4) The phone feels very premium and sturdy in hand.CONS:-1) Display issue as mentioned earlier.2) The camera could had been better, specially the front camera. The front camera under artificial light performs terribly bad."

Surpasses my expectations.,"  Oxygen OS coupled with Snapdragon 865 has really made the performance of the OnePlus 8 overwhelming.I was a bit skeptical about spending a hefty amount,however the experience with this device has been phenomenal.The battery backup is great,the camera is good and fingerprint sensor is the fastest.The brand has established itself with top of the line performance.Let us stop focussing on anything else and compare devices solely on the basis of sheer performance."

317,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),16 August 2020,Sourabh shrivastava,4.0 out of 5 stars,Device in nice but am facing heat issues,"  I got the delivery in 4 days. I must say packaging is worst, my phone box was damaged, they didn't pack it in a box or something. Phone is really good, it got everything inside. 90hz screen makes it really smooth, 865 makes it run very fluent and fast, and the OS is very personalized. Camera is also good they should have given a much better sensor in this price range but this also works really well. It struggles in low light but you will get really nice photos in daylight. the in hand feel is really amazing, the weight is apex 180 but it won't feel heavy while holding bcoz of its perfect weight distribution.But I experienced a major heat issue while I was playing games in it. In just 10 min it gets noticable heat which I thought is not good bcoz it got 865 snapd, best in market till now,. They replaced my product after blancco test, their assistance was really good"
318,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),31 July 2020,Varun Siddhu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,  Upgraded from OnePlus 5T to this product. While reviewing this product with 8pro I had plenty of doubts but at the I choose this one bcoz I didn't feel that 8pro has much differences with this and the price is too high if we talk about price gap between both products.8pro have wireless charging but they are not providing it as a complimentary but you have to pay for the wireless charger separately worth almost rs. 5K.If you are looking for best phone at 40K range. This is the amazing product to buy then. OnePlus never ever disappointed the user with OxygenOS. Smoothness of OxygenOS is world class.

The screen is awesome, the one thing is it doesn't have a e.tmm jack so you have to get a converter and need more updates on bug fixes for the apps. Battery is good still could be more optimised, overall bang for the buck! Can go for it."

BUT..,"  Here are some observations that I've noticed:CONS:1) The fingerprint scanner is not very efficient. It sometimes gives trouble scanning my finger.2) Surprisingly, the battery life of my phone couldn't last for 7 hrs of minimum usage which was disappointing.3) The camera is definitely an improvement over its predecessors but it still does not compete with some of the  higher end brands.PROS1) The Warp charger charged my phone in 1 hr from 9% to 100% which is pretty good.2) The 90hz refresh rate is just stunning! A very noticeable difference from 60-90.3) Stunning visuals, speakers and a well built body. It has a very premium feel attached to it.4) No lag in games. Quite a few games such as PUBG runs at 90 fps which is just marvelous.5) Barely any heating of the device as well.Overall, great phone. Must buy!"

346,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),6 October 2020,Vatsal,4.0 out of 5 stars,OnePlus 8 pros and cons explained in briefing:,"  I recently switched to OnePlus 8, my previous device was asus zenfone max zc550kl.Moving from such a budget device to a flagship like OnePlus definitely made me love this device.Its been just 2 days of usage but here are my thoughts:Display:The display is superimmersive,its hdr10 certified! The viewing angles are very good, no problem in dim light(has a dedicated bedroom mode and reading mode) The scrolling of apps is smooth thanks to the 90hertz refresh rate ,plus the display is clearly visible in bright sunlight.No compromises been done in the display department!Although I am afraid the diplay will shatter if I drop the phone once even with the already applied screen protector.(apply a new 3d curved tempered glass)Perfomance:The performance on this device has also been great! I am a gaming youtuber and this device is excellent for gaming you can have in 2020. I am a heavy user to note that! Player unknowns battlegrounds (global pubg) runs on ultra hd at ultra framerate with around 52 to 60 fps.Also the 6gb ram variant is quite sufficient for moderate users(can open 6 non heavy apps in back ground and 1 heavy app) has no issue at it.Love the oxygen is tho!Sound and Audio:The sound and Audio balancing is done very well on this OnePlus 8. The stereo speakers are uniformly loud,balanced and crisp. The dedicated Dolby Atmos is also useful and not gimmicky. Also the call quality is good too. In built Call recording is also good!Battery:The battery on this device has been excellent!  All thanks to the optimization done on oxygen os.On heavy usage I got upto 5.5 hrs of screen on time. That's very good! Also the warp charge 30T is very promising, gets the job done (full charge in 45-50 mins)Design:From the moment I bought the device I knew It was the design that wanted me to purchase this device than waiting for OnePlus 8t. I really love the curved diplay plus the curved design has got its own pros(horizon lights etc...)Almost edge to edge screen(with very small bezels on top and bottom).Security and locks:The fingerprint sensor is quite fast but sometimes it is not totally accurate out of 100 times it open like 80 times, the rest of the time it says ""too fast"" etc..Also same for the face unlock despite being fast as the fingerprint reader. That's a 4 out of 5 from me.Camera:As of now I haven't much tested this part, but yeah I took a couple of shots indoors and it did pretty good, we have last year's sensor on the back. It does the job but not that quite impressive that is why I use gcam on this device. The selfie camera is surprisingly good gets decent shots.The camera department has definitely some compromises for sure.(will upadte this camera briefing later after months usage)Video is stable idk why we don't have any option for 4k 120 fps atleast not asking for 8k video recording.I will update this review after a month's usage but it definitely a beast at its own. Also don't waste yor extra 3k on 8gb ram variant. Get this instead.Thankyou for reading. Have a great day."
347,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),25 July 2020,Nikita Bhanot,3.0 out of 5 stars,Camera! Camera! Camera!,  The main and foremost issue with this phone is it's camera i want oneplus to seriously update the issue with the camera as it shows the objects too bright and the pixels get broken when you zoom in. Overall phone is worth it but if you're a camera person I would not recommend you this phone.
348,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),9 July 2020,PIYUSH,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solid product,"  It gives you speed, accurary and latest tech you can get in a phone, Happy with the purchase.

349,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),6 July 2020,Avinash,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 star phone,  I am giving this review after 8 days usageDisplay is awesome you will experience next level in watching. Activate DC dimming in setting gives more clarityBattery is awesome with heavy usage I sill get 8.5 hrs screen on time. And 15 percent left at the end of the day. To extend battery life go to location and turn off wifi and Bluetooth scanningCamera quality is great photo and video experience is also next level . Video and photo clarity is very very good.Gaming is also smooth as butter . In game space go to setting and turn off graphics optimization it will give more clarity for game. PUBG is supporting excellent graphics HDR +  Extreme without any lag this phone will get you chicken dinner easily.Phone charges battery very quickly less then an hour . When you activate optimised charging in battery setting you can leave phone overnight it charges to 80 percent and charging stops at morning it will charge to 100 percent to extend battery life . Which is most useful feature just plug in overnight for charging.Overall very good phone and value for money. No other phone will give you experience like this phone 🥰♥️♥️I love this phone.

351,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),11 July 2020,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,No need to worry once you have oneplus,"  It is not a battery beast. Camera is not that great. Front camera is average. Software is as good as it hyped about. The haptics are brilliant. The screen is bright in sunlight. The speakers are amazing. The connectivity features are well covered. The lack of 3.5mm audio jack is something to be looked into. Network reception is good. The screen protector that comes within the box is not of any help.Had received a defective product, got replaced it with ease.Overall highly satisfied."

354,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),29 September 2020,Bhargav CH,5.0 out of 5 stars,Those Haptics!! OMG.,"  Well, there is a lot of mixed talk about this phone ""The OnePlus 8"". Lemme get this straight. The display of this phone is awesome. Better than every other smartphone's available at this price range. Performance is mind boggling. When you buy this phone and use this, you've got no idea what you are getting yourself into. And the cameras. Hey! Come on. We are android lovers. And the world of modded are ported apps is ours. I've been using the Google Camera port. And guess what, it's much better than the iph***'s. And not everyone notices this. But the haptics of this phone are so good that you literally can't stop using this phone from texting someone. I upgraded from OnePlus 6 to OnePlus 8. And I love what I did."

Had display issue.The issue is noticeable only in minimum brightness and in dark mode. The texts flickers when you would scroll.Asked for a replacement. Second device same problem. Now I have returned it.Camera - Not a Mobile photographer. Casual user. Absolutely pathetic for 42k. I tried it along M21. M21s selfie camera was better. And the portrait mode in oneplus 8 was creating depth effect like a 10k phone.Utterly disappointed with the quality.The camera is only good. If you're paying 10k.Battery. SOT of 5 and half hours in less than half brightness and 90 hz during my 1 week usage.It will go down as it ages.Performance - top notch. No complaints. Oxygen OS was smooth. App loading time was rapid.Security - Face unlock was very fast and fingerprint sometimes faulters otherwise it's quite good.

362,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),2 October 2020,Shubham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glacier green is totally different from pics. It's shady and beautiful.,"  Phone is just wow. Display is attractive.I have OnePlus 6t too but 8 is has many different features.Glacier green is stunning and totally different from pics shown.I wasn't ready to buy this color as I didn't like it in pics and videos. Actually, I hated this color but black wasn't available, so, purchased this one.Out of the box, I was amazed by the color. It's extremely shady and way to cool to brag.Camera is better than OnePlus 6T and definitely, you wouldn't like it if you compare it's pics with DSLR's. In one word, camera is too good and it's your skill how you capture the frame.90Hz display is way more crisp and sharp when compared with 60hz OnePlus 6T's.I loved the sound. 6T has Dirac HD sound which is awesome and feels like true HD but 8's sound is more cool because of Dolby. Just loved it.************** Premium Look************** Charging speed90 FPS on PUBG is available and I didn't feel any difference in 8gb OnePlus 6T ram and 6gb OnePlus 8 ram while playing PUBG.Overall, go for it. You won't be disappointed I bet.Thank me later :)"

A very good display and the green color looks fabulous. The camera quality is decent enough to capture good shotsI always go for black color but this time I did go for Green 6GB,128GB variant and it was a right decision. Battery life is very good as I am constantly getting 7-8 hours on medium to heavy usage. I played COD on full graphics and extreme settings and the game did not stutter once on 6GB RAM variant. So otherwise you want 256GB variant, 6GB is more than enough on OnePlus phones."

393,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),7 August 2020,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great deal at this price point but you have to manage with it's front camera quality.,"  Display quality is just mind blowing and it's 90hz amoled panel makes it buttery smooth with oxygen OS. User interface is elegant, simple and clean. Back camera is decent according to this price , it's give you a clear and perfect color combination and detailing is also there  BUT in front camera it's looses its charm , every time there image becomes shaky, unstable, noise , its just it's major downside i think. But in the rest of the aspects the Phone is performing amazing and it's form factor will give an premium feel and very handy to use. Easy to use with single handed ."
394,OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage),5 July 2020,Simrat Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impresses,"  Real fast delivery from Amazon,been using this phone for past 20 days,just loving it's speed and display,pubg performance at highest settings is top notch,display is too good, battery life is just amazing,speakers are also too good as well,main problem is that charging speed is getting slower and slower,I don't know why,during first It used to be charged in just under 60 min, but after 20 days it's taking about 80 minutes,which is still good but,if u are pubg competitive player u should definitely go for it rather than XR,I truly suggest this it's fnatic mode really helps to control ping as well"

It has the best display with 90hz refresh rate which is ultra smooth. Battery life is better than average. For casual users, one day of battery life is a guarantee.

The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward."

447,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",11 March 2019,Soumalya Chakraborty,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Cameras and Performance,"  Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default ""vibrant"" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them."
448,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",18 May 2019,shubham a.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Please Read Crefully before buying !,"  Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !"

Main reason is the screen size to view videos or games.5.if you play games like clash of kings or pubg the battery will last a few hours. As on any other similar segment phone.6.has live message / ar emojis7.company provided back case is best if you want to keep it light.(Hard plastic clear case)8.white colored akg headset with the box accessories.  Good for basic calling and music.9. Bixby button can be reassigned to another app.10. Camera quality is very nice. Both front and back.11. Hybrid slot for two sims or one sim and one memory card.12. The 5g doesn't have second sim option and no hrm sensor. So choose between the two."

454,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",7 September 2020,Akash,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy even in 2020!,"  I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now."

459,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",29 April 2019,Man Malviya,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Samsung Galaxy S10+ is an ""Amazing"" smartphone","  I am writing this review after one month of purchase, and I've to say this phone is what exactly I've paid for and really worth of that money. Samsung has done many changes this flagship phone compared to Note 9 (i also own) and really exceeded my expectations.**Important Info** The one thing that I was so disappointed about is it ""Packaging"" the seller didn't send it with care (Proper packaging) and its original box was harmed due to shipping but my Galaxy S10+ and the contents inside the box was unharmed.Here is my honest review of this phone1. Display: This phone's OLED display is one of the finest work I've seen from Samsung and the Infinity-O cutout doesn't look weird at all. I am using it for a month now the display is not affected a bit and looks beautiful the color correction of the screen is marvelous and vivid.The Ultrasonic fingerprint is also something new that I like about this phone.10/10 for the Display.2. Performance: 8GB of RAM + 128GB of internal is storage can handle any kind of application or games that I want to play or scrub through. The performance of Galaxy S10+ is unmatched and i don't need to compromise on any kind of performance related stuff. 10/10 for the Performance3. Battery: I can use Galaxy S10+ for about 12-14 hours rapid fire with my heavy usages apps including 4-5 hours for,  and there's 15Watt charging speed to recharge it in a decent amount of time but I wanted a 25Watt charger. Moreover, with S10 series Samsung introduced the new ""Wireless Powershare"" feature, which is quite useful to share power with other phones but it's slow but it's more powerful that Huawei P30 Pro. I give this a 7/10 for not including the 25Watt charger ;)4. Camera: The Triple camera on the back can really make your picture look professional and gives you all the ability to shoot any kind of scenario, the most amazing feature are new.*Ultra-Wide angle shot which allows me to capture a massive amount of details in a single shot (that's awesome),*The low light photography has been also improved by Samsung, because I've recently received a ""Night Mode"" which can capture low light images better than ever but still below Pixels 3's Night Sight photograph but I wanted Samsung to improve it more.Front Camera: There are two cameras ready for you in the front side that can capture amazing selfies and the second camera allows me to capture sharper and accurate Bokeh shots in the Live Focus mode, and there's a new feature.Video: The phone's Video capturing ability is unmatched and records 4K video from rear and front camera sides, and the video stabilization of both lenses is best in the market.The score for camera setup is 9/10 (Need to improve Night time photographs)5. Design: My Galaxy S10+ is in Prism White color, and this is not a lie but the new gradient/hue color scheme on the back gives a premium look to this premium phone. 10/10 for the Design.Note for Fortnite Player: If you're a serious Fortnite player, the phone comes with an exclusive ""IKONIK"" outfit that you can redeem."

461,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",6 August 2020,Chinmay P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sleek, Fast and Classy. A Perfectly Balanced All-Rounder.","  S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket."
462,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",4 August 2020,Sandeep Nangia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Marvellous Masterpiece,"  Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung."

I am a regular customer and prime subscriber. After 1 year of use , suddenly the phone went blank. I was not able to restart it. Took it to Samsung service centre in Kolkata near Bellevue clinic in Minto park. They told me motherboard is out of order and one thikng they told me that "" NFC is missing..your mobile has been operated before"". This means before I bought it, it had been mishandled or something else. What is Amazon doing, either they are selling false product or something else, 😠they even couldn't give guarantee to it. Worst service ever. Shame on you!😠 Never buy Samsung phones from Amazon."
469,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",10 April 2019,Alex Paul T,4.0 out of 5 stars,The most you can get from a Mobile,"  HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It’s the best I have used so far and it’s the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It’s the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it’s a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn’t scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it’s not affecting the performance by any significant amount it’s just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don’t take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don’t think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition."

However hope this can be further extended with software updates down the line by Samsung😐 .One UI 2.5 (current version installed) is pretty neat but i feel it still needs few tweaking in terms of heavy animations used (u can restrict this under Advanced Features). Overall a very good UI, pleasing to eye.Response time & switching between apps has no lag whatsoever, smooth in all aspect.Cell reception is pretty good as compared to my previous phones, so no complaints again.High quality camera with a bulk load of options...😃Basically the S10+ an all in one phone with importance given to both performance & features along with a good designWould Highly recommend to others..P.S - Still wondering why Samsung has given a dedicated key for Bixby :), nevertheless you can modify it.."
472,"Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus (White, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost...",19 July 2019,AZ,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought new product, received old product, replacement as well not up to the mark","  Not upto the mark product by Samsung and service from Amazon.Product wasn't packaged properly, was just sent in Amazon place wrapping without any bubble wrap.  Ideally it should have been sent in a well packaged carton with bubble packaging. Phone box outer plastic cover was partially torn and edges of the box where bit crushed. Inside the phone had marks on the screen and back.As far as the phone is concerned, it has signal issues, fast charging is a myth and takes hours to fully charge (really want to experience fast charging check out one plus), phone heats up and the overall experience for the premium paid isn't justified. I moved from 1+ 5T to 10+ and all I can say is 5T beats it hands down. The most noticeable thing about 10+ is only its display and if the display is only thing under your consideration than better buy a good TV at this price range."

The selfie camera, however, is not up to the mark.The biggest issue I am facing is the phone overheats way too frequently. It overheats even when it is being charged and not being used. It also gets very hot if I take it out in the sun, the metallic surface gets really hot and then it's not easy to touch it all.The battery also seems to drain pretty fast, doesn't last a day like it claims. A phone this expensive should have better battery back up. Also takes more than an hour to fully charge despite a fast charger.I really love the performance and the display but I do wish I had opted for the iPhone instead of this one, due to the battery and the selfie camera."

I switched from OnePlus 7pro to Samsung S10+ but like seriously? My one plus handset is quite amazing in front of s10+. I never really expected this outcome seriously!

643,"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (Black, 12GB RAM, 128 Storage) with No Cost...",20 May 2020,Aziz Latiwala,1.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung is becoming a Dinosaur (soon to be extinct),"  So after paying over 21% more than last year's Samsung Galaxy S10 plus, Samsung took the courtesy to sell me a phone which is 20% slower than even a mid range phone! It is pretty evident that their Ultra Flagship phone is even slower than last year's Snapdragon 855. Afterall Samsung phones only make decent paperweights now as practically they are far inferior when compared to better brand phones costing less than half the price. Having only used Samsung S series since the origin of android I think it is now time to venture with better brands. Predictable that Samsung is soon to be obsolete and make the same mistake Nokia did. While Nokia never cheated their customers I'm sure there's more coming to Samsung."
644,"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (Black, 12GB RAM, 128 Storage) with No Cost...",7 April 2020,Sanjay Joshi,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not Recommended,"  I pre-ordered two units of this phone. And canceled both of them after getting to know they have used Exynos in it. They have not clearly mentioned it anywhere. The Exynos is so bad that there is even a petition against the chipset in change org.Cons because of the Exynos processor:-) Underperforming device-) Bad battery life-) Gets heated very quickly.-) Bad image processing hence bad camera (photo) quality-) Bad AI processingAdditional Cons:-) The fingerprint reader is slower than the competition-) They use the Sony IMX image sensor in US market and in house sensors in India and some other countries. Which ends up with bad picture quality.-) Cannot use 120 Hz refresh rate and QHD together (most probably because the battery will not last even for 2-3 hours when both are used together, so they have disabled it completely)Pros:+) Good screen when using the 120 Hz refresh rate. But you will have to reduce resolution to FHD from QHD to use it."

I guess samsung treats us Indians as fools! A question to samsung..why not Snapdragon 865SoC for Indian version also. Where it is way much more performant than the exynos processors. Atleast provide an option to the customer to opt for the SoC.

647,"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (Black, 12GB RAM, 128 Storage) with No Cost...",18 March 2020,THE BOSS,5.0 out of 5 stars,5 STAR RATING,"  Great Device ,JUST upgraded from Note 10 +Read my review , hope it will help you1. Display ( 5/5 ) - Samsung brand makes one of the greatest displays in the smartphone industry , This is absolutely best .. Quad Hd Amoled Dynamic Display is a treat .... The display size is around 7 which is great who likes big sized phones ( like me )...2 . Sound ( 4.5/5 ) - Better sound and louder than my previous note 10 + ....... You will enjoy the sound quality in games or while watching movies3 . Sensors ( 4.5/5 ) - Face unlock is super fast and fingerprint is also good .....4 . Battery ( 4.5/5 ) - I should say 5000mah battery is superb , If you keep 120 Hz refresh rate on , then 6 HR average screen time you should get ..... But if you use 60 Hz and Quad Hd resolution then 8 - 9 HR screen time on heavy usage and 10 + hrs on normal usage which is goodPerformance ( 4/5 ) : slightly better performance than note 10 + , Overall good performance but Exynos processers are behind Snapdragon , but performance is still very good and 120Hz refresh rate is awesome but consumes a bit battery ( using dark theme and wallpaper is my opinion ) If you need a s-pen then stay away , wait for note 20....Camera ( 4/5 ) : The main highlight of this phone .... Good pics but the auto focus fails sometimes , but will fix this issue soon with updates ..... 100X zoom is fabulous , even though pics are little broken , but good pics . If you like to take high quality pics , then you must look at this phone ( If your budget around 100k )Hope my detailed review helps . Thanks"

Virtually it has everything what you look for or maybe more than you think.. well its a bit overpriced to be handy but its worth all if you ready to spend..the offer on the samsung buds seems didnt worked initially but eventually it did now and its on the way.Camera is the best in any phone which i have seen intill date. ok the 100x zoom seems saleable addon,it works too but dont seem anybody would be using it..as people nowadys use less zoom nowadays.. rest camera features are powerfull.and the low light night mode photos come out very good as it boast a bigger sensor. eventually photography doesnt totally depend on the cameea you use it but also skills you to posses..the battery life is very good..its larger and charges quickly with its super fast charging.this phone is dream.. and 2 months down..it havent dissapointed me."
655,"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (Black, 12GB RAM, 128 Storage) with No Cost...",3 April 2020,chandrika padmanabhan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Samsung S20 ultra review,"  This is my second week I started using mini computer, easily the best phone I've spent my money on, absolutely no regrets buying this.The best part is display, which is amazing , the 120hz option feels so smooth and the high resolution with a vivid display looks great. Videos viewed on this phone are truly amazing.The fingerprint and face recognition are extremely fast, and the animations are also eye catching.Don't have to think about charging my mobile at all.The battery is truly great , with 5000maH it seems to last forever and I never worry about charging it at all , and even then it charges incredibly fast, battery life on this phone isn't an issue at allThe camera is easily one of the best features of the phone if not the best , captures images with so much color and the night mode is brilliant , all the zoom capabilities are also a great add on , with the ultra wide being my personal favourite. The different camera options also are great , feels like you have a DSLR on your phone. The 108 MP camera gives you the ability to screenshot pictures from a picture still looking great. The video stabilization works perfectly well.The phone is obviously ultra fast , with 16 GB ram , with an option of even assigning part of the ram to different apps to stay open in the background and open off right where you left them. You can literally keep 20 apps open and the phone will the same.The simple UI makes sure the user can operate the phone easilyThe speakers are absolute bangers, extremely loud and the sound doesn't get distorted like most phones when they get loud. Even the AKG earphones in the box sound goodThe call quality is noticeably great , the voice of the person's voice is very clearThe Bluetooth on this phone is also faster than most phones I've used , pairs to devices faster and also Samsung has added a software that allows you to play music in your friends phone using the quick share feature which is great because no time is wasted for pairing. However this is only available on phones with the Music Share feature.Storage options on the phone are great with a expandable storage upto 1 TB if anyone requires that much.Samsung has done a great job again this year to make a phone packed with every feature possible, but surely nothing is perfect, although this phone almost is.The space zoom feature with a 100x zoom is a great feature but it does not give great images , the place should be very well lit to get a image that looks fine,Also the 8k video feature is a shaky as videos can only be shot in 30fpsBut props to Samsung for adding the features in the phone and trying something wildI wish that the display can be adjusted to using it with 120hz and the WQHD+(3200 x 1440) display at the same time, the phone only enables 120hz with the FHD+(2440 x 1080) display.The phone gets a little warm when using the 120hz display , however doesn't really affect the phones performanceAlso since the display is huge, it will be slightly tough for people with small hands to operate the phone an reach the top of the device , however Samsung has provided a one hand mode to solve this. It is a big device, but the feature fit into this phone justify thatIn conclusion , this phone is a great buy with literally every feature maxed out on this phone, one has to nitpick to find faults with this phone, if this is within your budget you should definitely buy it."

I pre-ordered the phone with buds offer, but it is not activated on Samsung shop app. Samsung Shop app says my IMEI is not eligible for offer. Samsung shop support reconfirmed it.

671,"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (Black, 12GB RAM, 128 Storage) with No Cost...",7 August 2020,Prakash Choudhary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best phone i ever use,"  Talking about the display and the front design (as I had written it my S20+ review as well), the new generation Dyamic AMOLED screen on the S20 series is now more flatter. The overall design looks more refined as a standalone product when you compare it with the two generations of S series. The bezels are super thin on this panel, and I loved the experience of A+ grade QHD AMOLED display.￼Now coming to the display performance, the front 6.9-inch QHD panel is the best among flagship from Samsung in 2020. There's a 120Hz refresh rate option that helps deliver a smooth experience. However, you can't select the QHD and 120Hz refresh rate together. Samsung has customized the display panel to operate at 60Hz by default. So in order to use this display with its highest 120Hz refresh rate, you'll need to comprise with resolution.SAMSUNG GALAXY S20 ULTRA: PERFORMANCE AND UIJust like the other two Samsung Galaxy S20 series variants, the Ultra also comes with Samsung's own Exynos 990 chipset in India instead of the Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 SoC. The biggest drawback here is that this SoC supports 4G LTE and not the 5G. While I see that Samsung purposely made the decision to leave out 5G for India because the network rollout hasn't even started here, but in my opinion, it should have been included considering the S20 Ultra is a top-end high value premium phone which will at least serve well for minimum three years. Globally, Samsung ships it with Snapdragon 865 with integrated 5G modem, which is currently the flagship chipset model like the global market.￼With 4G LTE onboard, this Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra comes backed by 12GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Although, this is not the top-end model of the Ultra by global standards, but I feel the real-world performance of this configuration will surprise you for good. This 7nm+ Exynos 990 chipset combined with Samsung's One UI 2.1 performs exceptionally well for daily multitasking and for heavy-graphic games like the PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty.That said, the phone does get a little warmed up during prolonged gaming and while recording videos. you still might feel a little warming issue in the device during stretched gaming time. Overall, the performance of S20+ is at par for a flagship phone without any doubt.￼Coming to the UI, as I had written in my Samsung Galaxy S20+ review, the Android 10-based One UI 2.1 is one of the better overlay in Android space than any other Chinese competition devices except the OnePlus' Oxygen OS or stock Android in my opinion. Samsung has improved a lot on the interface, and we can expect more improvements with Android 11 in the coming days.SAMSUNG GALAXY S20 ULTRA: CAMERA PERFORMANCE REVIEWIn three S20 series of phones this year, the biggest difference is in the camera setup. The Galaxy S20 Ultra packs one of the big numbers in the camera department with 108-megapixel primary lens. It's the biggest camera sensor Samsung has ever put on a smartphone. The other three lenses in the quad-camera setup include a 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto lens next to a depth vision camera and the flash. Also, at the front, there is a a 40-megapixel shooter, which sits in the tiny punch-hole of Samsung's Super AMOLED 120Hz Infinity-O display.￼During my two-month review time, I found Galaxy S20 Ultra to be flawless for all kinds of daylight shots. In fact, it is even better than the S20+ which I was using before it. By default, the camera clicks rich, detailed 12-megapixel images in daylight, and the AI scene optimizer works brilliantly with all images in auto mode. Coming to the night shots, the camera setup again holds up to good details. Even the HDR also meters correctly. The 'Night mode' in particular makes the entire scene look brighter dramatically. While some may like it, I preferred night mode off in most cases, because it did pretty well otherwise.For those looking to get 108-megapixel shot, this mode can be enabled from the top menu options. You'll find it under image aspect ratio section. Honestly, it seems like, Samsung has hidden it there purposely, so many people don't use it maybe. The 108-megapixel image usually, had an image size of about 35-40MB for me. These are heavy images, and incorporate a lot of details. Coming to the pro mode, it is a pure bliss for professional level photographers.Now coming to the crazy part, the 100X zoom. This is something you'll enjoy seeing distant objects, but there is not much use of it for images. Yes, the camera zooms brilliantly goes up to 100x and I was surprised to see that it could preview in real-time. That said, it was difficult to keep the hand steady for 100x zoom click, but if you hold tight or use a tripod, you'll easily get a clean AI processed image for your social media."

And I am not disappointed. The got it delivered well within the delivery time. The phone is a beast.Battery lasts more than a solid day even on a strenuous use. I dont game but I constantly stream and it doesn't seem to drain the battery as much as you'd think. I run my display on 120Hz, so smooth is the new cool. Yes the camera has some issues, it having a very buggy auto focus on close objects, but thats not as amendable as you'd want given the camera has a very narrow Aperture. Still hoping for some improvements over the software updates. IP rating stands by its words and I have had no trouble taking underwater photos from the same either."
674,"Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (Black, 12GB RAM, 128 Storage) with No Cost...",26 August 2020,Karthik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellant  and beautiful SmartPhone,"  Basically used to have Apple products . Felt that apple products were much better than other smart phones.  Also in the past I used to have Samsung S Duos and Galaxy S7. Their performance were not upto standards.  This time  for a change I thought of buying Samsung S20 Ultra. I have the cosmic grey version. Initially I was not very sure about its performance. Now I am super impressed with its performance for the following reason1. Battery life  : It almost lasts me for more than 1 day . Am a heavy user for various apps. Also the apps work seamlessly without any hassle.  The transition between the apps is also very nice2. Clear pictures3. It has a very nice sound quality .4. Becasues of the large screen size it is very easy to operate and there are lot of more features which i am super impressedI have paired by my phone with Samsung Galaxy buds+ and  Samsung S3 watch (46mm). So my workouts are getting synced without any hassle.With all this I would like to mention that I am super impressed with my phone . It is a steal. Except that the price is slightly on a higher side, but that gets neglected because of the features it offers"

Camera has tremendously improved including the night photography and exceptionally outstanding long shot. Samsung has excelled in it. And not to forget the battery life. Even with a 120hz refresh rate, being more than a day with heavy usage (other than gaming).Only flaw, that too A bit lower side is the facial recognition. Takes at times a bit too much time, especially at night. IPhone excels here by a huge margin.But overall 8.5/10Kudos samsung. Keep up the good work. Hugely satisfied with this investment.Ps: try the galaxy bud +. Takes the experience to a whole new level overall."

They are costly and premium phones but samsung has the worst update policy. After 2 updates they don't give any android version software updates. If you have a lot of money to waste after every 2 years then you should buy it. They launch the phone with old android version , after launching they give first android update within 3 or 4 months which became older for all other phones and the second and the last update after 1 year then your phone is finished for samsung."

Using this phone from last 7 days and sharing my experience with you all if any one planning for this handset1. Phone look cool and nice in hand. Many will ask for you and want to hold your cell in their hand2. Battery life is okay. If I play PUBG during my busy working day life battery get drain fastly but thanks to battery capacity its 5050mah it keep last a day any how3. Screen and sound is awesome. You can trust this one blind4. Front camera is good and capture nice selfie5. Back camera is main high light of this phone and comes with 4 camera setup. 100x zoom makes photo unclear and pixels got crash. But 80x zoom works really nice. But you can amaze your friends with 100x zoom6. This beast come with super fast charger who charge your cell really fast. If want you can buy 45watt charger cost rupree 3000 for more fast charging7. Hdfc cashback is adding one star in your buy8. Akg earpiece goes really smooth with music and you will love earpiece9. Samsung should upgrade case cover provide with phone. Cover come with phone is not really cool. I bought another cover from Samsung store which look really nice n cool.10. Verdict is you can buy this beast and your lac will not make you unhappyBest of luck and enjoy your phone

       "\"  Great phone!Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings!I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands.Camera is good, can't say it is awesome!Battery life is great too, charge too fast!UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one!Over all a great phone!Cheers! :)\""
